Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or&#10;five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”&#10;&#10;“How so? How can it affect them?”&#10;&#10;“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You&#10;must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”&#10;&#10;“Is that his design in settling here?”&#10;&#10;“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he&#10;_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as&#10;soon as he comes.”&#10;&#10;“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send&#10;them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are&#10;as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the&#10;party.”&#10;&#10;“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but&#10;I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five&#10;grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”&#10;&#10;“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”&#10;&#10;“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into&#10;the neighbourhood.”&#10;&#10;“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”&#10;&#10;“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would&#10;be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to&#10;go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no&#10;newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to&#10;visit him if you do not.”&#10;&#10;“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very&#10;glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my&#10;hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though&#10;I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”&#10;&#10;“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the&#10;others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so&#10;good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”&#10;&#10;“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are&#10;all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of&#10;quickness than her sisters.”&#10;&#10;“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You&#10;take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”&#10;&#10;“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They&#10;are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration&#10;these last twenty years at least.”&#10;&#10;“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”&#10;&#10;“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four&#10;thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”&#10;&#10;“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not&#10;visit them.”&#10;&#10;“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them&#10;all.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,&#10;reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had&#10;been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind&#10;was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,&#10;little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,&#10;she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her&#10;daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 2&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He&#10;had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring&#10;his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was&#10;paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following&#10;manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he&#10;suddenly addressed her with:&#10;&#10;“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”&#10;&#10;“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother&#10;resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”&#10;&#10;“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the&#10;assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”&#10;&#10;“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces&#10;of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion&#10;of her.”&#10;&#10;“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do&#10;not depend on her serving you.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain&#10;herself, began scolding one of her daughters.&#10;&#10;“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little&#10;compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”&#10;&#10;“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times&#10;them ill.”&#10;&#10;“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is&#10;your next ball to be, Lizzy?”&#10;&#10;“To-morrow fortnight.”&#10;&#10;“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back&#10;till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,&#10;for she will not know him herself.”&#10;&#10;“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce&#10;Mr. Bingley to _her_.”&#10;&#10;“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him&#10;myself; how can you be so teasing?”&#10;&#10;“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly&#10;very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a&#10;fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,&#10;Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as&#10;she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will&#10;take it on myself.”&#10;&#10;The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,&#10;nonsense!”&#10;&#10;“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do&#10;you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on&#10;them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,&#10;Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read&#10;great books and make extracts.”&#10;&#10;Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.&#10;&#10;“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.&#10;Bingley.”&#10;&#10;“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.&#10;&#10;“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If&#10;I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called&#10;on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we&#10;cannot escape the acquaintance now.”&#10;&#10;The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.&#10;Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy&#10;was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the&#10;while.&#10;&#10;“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should&#10;persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to&#10;neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a&#10;good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a&#10;word about it till now.”&#10;&#10;“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,&#10;as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.&#10;&#10;“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was&#10;shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;&#10;or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so&#10;pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but&#10;for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_&#10;the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next&#10;ball.”&#10;&#10;“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the&#10;youngest, I’m the tallest.”&#10;&#10;The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would&#10;return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to&#10;dinner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 3&#10;&#10;&#10;Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five&#10;daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her&#10;husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him&#10;in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and&#10;distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at&#10;last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,&#10;Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been&#10;delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely&#10;agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly&#10;with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of&#10;dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively&#10;hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.&#10;&#10;“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”&#10; said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well&#10;married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”&#10;&#10;In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about&#10;ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being&#10;admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had&#10;heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more&#10;fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper&#10;window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.&#10;&#10;An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already&#10;had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her&#10;housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley&#10;was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable&#10;to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite&#10;disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town&#10;so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that&#10;he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never&#10;settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears&#10;a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get&#10;a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley&#10;was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.&#10;The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the&#10;day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only&#10;six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when&#10;the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five&#10;altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and&#10;another young man.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant&#10;countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,&#10;with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely&#10;looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention&#10;of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and&#10;the report which was in general circulation within five minutes&#10;after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen&#10;pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he&#10;was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great&#10;admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust&#10;which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be&#10;proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all&#10;his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most&#10;forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared&#10;with his friend.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal&#10;people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,&#10;was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving&#10;one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for&#10;themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced&#10;only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being&#10;introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in&#10;walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.&#10;His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man&#10;in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.&#10;Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of&#10;his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his&#10;having slighted one of her daughters.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit&#10;down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been&#10;standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.&#10;Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend&#10;to join it.&#10;&#10;“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you&#10;standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better&#10;dance.”&#10;&#10;“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am&#10;particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this&#10;it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not&#10;another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to&#10;stand up with.”&#10;&#10;“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a&#10;kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in&#10;my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see&#10;uncommonly pretty.”&#10;&#10;“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.&#10;Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.&#10;&#10;“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one&#10;of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I&#10;dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”&#10;&#10;“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at&#10;Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:&#10;“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no&#10;humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted&#10;by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her&#10;smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth&#10;remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,&#10;however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,&#10;playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.&#10;&#10;The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.&#10;Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield&#10;party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been&#10;distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as&#10;her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s&#10;pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most&#10;accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been&#10;fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they&#10;had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good&#10;spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they&#10;were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With&#10;a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a&#10;good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised&#10;such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife’s views on&#10;the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a&#10;different story to hear.&#10;&#10;“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most&#10;delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.&#10;Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well&#10;she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with&#10;her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her&#10;twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second&#10;time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand&#10;up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody&#10;can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going&#10;down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and&#10;asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,&#10;and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,&#10;and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--”&#10;&#10;“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,&#10;“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of&#10;his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”&#10;&#10;“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively&#10;handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw&#10;anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.&#10;Hurst’s gown--”&#10;&#10;Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any&#10;description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch&#10;of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some&#10;exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.&#10;&#10;“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not&#10;suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at&#10;all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring&#10;him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very&#10;great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my&#10;dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 4&#10;&#10;&#10;When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in&#10;her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very&#10;much she admired him.&#10;&#10;“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,&#10;good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much&#10;ease, with such perfect good breeding!”&#10;&#10;“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought&#10;likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”&#10;&#10;“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I&#10;did not expect such a compliment.”&#10;&#10;“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between&#10;us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What&#10;could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help&#10;seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman&#10;in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is&#10;very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a&#10;stupider person.”&#10;&#10;“Dear Lizzy!”&#10;&#10;“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.&#10;You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable&#10;in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your&#10;life.”&#10;&#10;“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak&#10;what I think.”&#10;&#10;“I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_&#10;good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of&#10;others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it&#10;everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the&#10;good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing&#10;of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man’s sisters,&#10;too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”&#10;&#10;“Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you&#10;converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep&#10;his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming&#10;neighbour in her.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at&#10;the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more&#10;quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,&#10;and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she&#10;was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine&#10;ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the&#10;power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and&#10;conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the&#10;first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand&#10;pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of&#10;associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect&#10;entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of&#10;a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply&#10;impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their&#10;own had been acquired by trade.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred&#10;thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an&#10;estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and&#10;sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a&#10;good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those&#10;who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the&#10;remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to&#10;purchase.&#10;&#10;His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,&#10;though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no&#10;means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had&#10;married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider&#10;his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of&#10;age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation&#10;to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for&#10;half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal&#10;rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it&#10;immediately.&#10;&#10;Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of&#10;great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the&#10;easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition&#10;could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he&#10;never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley&#10;had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.&#10;In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means&#10;deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,&#10;reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not&#10;inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley&#10;was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually&#10;giving offense.&#10;&#10;The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently&#10;characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or&#10;prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive&#10;to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt&#10;acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not&#10;conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a&#10;collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for&#10;none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received&#10;either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,&#10;but she smiled too much.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired&#10;her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one&#10;whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore&#10;established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such&#10;commendation to think of her as he chose.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 5&#10;&#10;&#10;Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets&#10;were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade&#10;in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the&#10;honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.&#10;The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a&#10;disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;&#10;and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house&#10;about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,&#10;where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,&#10;unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all&#10;the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him&#10;supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By&#10;nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.&#10;James’s had made him courteous.&#10;&#10;Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a&#10;valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest&#10;of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was&#10;Elizabeth’s intimate friend.&#10;&#10;That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over&#10;a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly&#10;brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.&#10;&#10;“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil&#10;self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”&#10;&#10;“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be&#10;sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he&#10;_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something&#10;about Mr. Robinson.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not&#10;I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton&#10;assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many&#10;pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his&#10;answering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,&#10;beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”&#10;&#10;“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as&#10;if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”&#10;&#10;“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said&#10;Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,&#10;is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.”&#10;&#10;“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his&#10;ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite&#10;a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he&#10;sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”&#10;&#10;“Are you quite sure, ma’am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.&#10;“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”&#10;&#10;“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he&#10;could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at&#10;being spoke to.”&#10;&#10;“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,&#10;unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably&#10;agreeable.”&#10;&#10;“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very&#10;agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it&#10;was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had&#10;heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to&#10;the ball in a hack chaise.”&#10;&#10;“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I&#10;wish he had danced with Eliza.”&#10;&#10;“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,&#10;if I were you.”&#10;&#10;“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”&#10;&#10;“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride&#10;often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so&#10;very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,&#10;should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_&#10;to be proud.”&#10;&#10;“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive&#10;_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”&#10;&#10;“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her&#10;reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have&#10;ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human&#10;nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us&#10;who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some&#10;quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different&#10;things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may&#10;be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of&#10;ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”&#10;&#10;“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with&#10;his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of&#10;foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”&#10;&#10;“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.&#10;Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle&#10;directly.”&#10;&#10;The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she&#10;would, and the argument ended only with the visit.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 6&#10;&#10;&#10;The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit&#10;was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on&#10;the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was&#10;found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,&#10;a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards&#10;the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest&#10;pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment&#10;of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;&#10;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in&#10;all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It&#10;was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and&#10;to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference&#10;which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a&#10;way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it&#10;was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane&#10;united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a&#10;uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions&#10;of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.&#10;&#10;“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose&#10;on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be&#10;so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill&#10;from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and&#10;it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in&#10;the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every&#10;attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all&#10;_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are&#10;very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without&#10;encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_&#10;affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he&#10;may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”&#10;&#10;“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can&#10;perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to&#10;discover it too.”&#10;&#10;“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”&#10;&#10;“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal&#10;it, he must find it out.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane&#10;meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they&#10;always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that&#10;every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should&#10;therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his&#10;attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for&#10;falling in love as much as she chooses.”&#10;&#10;“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in&#10;question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined&#10;to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But&#10;these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,&#10;she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its&#10;reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four&#10;dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,&#10;and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite&#10;enough to make her understand his character.”&#10;&#10;“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might&#10;only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must&#10;remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four&#10;evenings may do a great deal.”&#10;&#10;“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they&#10;both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other&#10;leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”&#10;&#10;“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and&#10;if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a&#10;chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a&#10;twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If&#10;the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or&#10;ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the&#10;least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to&#10;have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as&#10;possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your&#10;life.”&#10;&#10;“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not&#10;sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”&#10;&#10;Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth&#10;was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some&#10;interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely&#10;allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the&#10;ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no&#10;sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly&#10;had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered&#10;uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To&#10;this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had&#10;detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry&#10;in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and&#10;pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those&#10;of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of&#10;this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made&#10;himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough&#10;to dance with.&#10;&#10;He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing&#10;with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so&#10;drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were&#10;assembled.&#10;&#10;“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my&#10;conversation with Colonel Forster?”&#10;&#10;“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”&#10;&#10;“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see&#10;what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by&#10;being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”&#10;&#10;On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have&#10;any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such&#10;a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she&#10;turned to him and said:&#10;&#10;“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly&#10;well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at&#10;Meryton?”&#10;&#10;“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady&#10;energetic.”&#10;&#10;“You are severe on us.”&#10;&#10;“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going&#10;to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”&#10;&#10;“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me&#10;to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken&#10;a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would&#10;really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of&#10;hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,&#10;she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing&#10;at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of&#10;course familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I&#10;shall keep mine to swell my song.”&#10;&#10;Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song&#10;or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that&#10;she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her&#10;sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in&#10;the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always&#10;impatient for display.&#10;&#10;Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her&#10;application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited&#10;manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she&#10;had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with&#10;much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the&#10;end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by&#10;Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,&#10;with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in&#10;dancing at one end of the room.&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of&#10;passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too&#10;much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was&#10;his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:&#10;&#10;“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There&#10;is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first&#10;refinements of polished society.”&#10;&#10;“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst&#10;the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”&#10;&#10;Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he&#10;continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt&#10;not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”&#10;&#10;“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do&#10;you often dance at St. James’s?”&#10;&#10;“Never, sir.”&#10;&#10;“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”&#10;&#10;“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”&#10;&#10;“You have a house in town, I conclude?”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy bowed.&#10;&#10;“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond&#10;of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of&#10;London would agree with Lady Lucas.”&#10;&#10;He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed&#10;to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was&#10;struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to&#10;her:&#10;&#10;“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow&#10;me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You&#10;cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”&#10; And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though&#10;extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly&#10;drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:&#10;&#10;“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you&#10;not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of&#10;her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at&#10;all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.&#10;&#10;“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny&#10;me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the&#10;amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us&#10;for one half-hour.”&#10;&#10;“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.&#10;&#10;“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,&#10;we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a&#10;partner?”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not&#10;injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some&#10;complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:&#10;&#10;“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”&#10;&#10;“I should imagine not.”&#10;&#10;“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings&#10;in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.&#10;I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the&#10;nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would&#10;I give to hear your strictures on them!”&#10;&#10;“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more&#10;agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure&#10;which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he&#10;would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.&#10;Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:&#10;&#10;“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”&#10;&#10;“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.&#10;How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you&#10;joy?”&#10;&#10;“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s&#10;imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love&#10;to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”&#10;&#10;“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is&#10;absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;&#10;and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”&#10;&#10;He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to&#10;entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her&#10;that all was safe, her wit flowed long.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 7&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two&#10;thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,&#10;in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s&#10;fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply&#10;the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and&#10;had left her four thousand pounds.&#10;&#10;She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to&#10;their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in&#10;London in a respectable line of trade.&#10;&#10;The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most&#10;convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted&#10;thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and&#10;to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,&#10;Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;&#10;their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing&#10;better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning&#10;hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news&#10;the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some&#10;from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with&#10;news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the&#10;neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the&#10;headquarters.&#10;&#10;Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most&#10;interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge&#10;of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a&#10;secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.&#10;Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of&#10;felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and&#10;Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation&#10;to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the&#10;regimentals of an ensign.&#10;&#10;After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.&#10;Bennet coolly observed:&#10;&#10;“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two&#10;of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but&#10;I am now convinced.”&#10;&#10;Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect&#10;indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,&#10;and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the&#10;next morning to London.&#10;&#10;“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so&#10;ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly&#10;of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”&#10;&#10;“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”&#10;&#10;“Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”&#10;&#10;“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I&#10;had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must&#10;so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly&#10;foolish.”&#10;&#10;“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of&#10;their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will&#10;not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when&#10;I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my&#10;heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,&#10;should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought&#10;Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in&#10;his regimentals.”&#10;&#10;“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain&#10;Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first&#10;came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with&#10;a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited&#10;for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was&#10;eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,&#10;&#10;“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,&#10;Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”&#10;&#10;“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.&#10;&#10;“MY DEAR FRIEND,--&#10;&#10;“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,&#10;we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,&#10;for a whole day’s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a&#10;quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the&#10;gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,&#10;&#10;“CAROLINE BINGLEY”&#10;&#10;“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of&#10;_that_.”&#10;&#10;“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”&#10;&#10;“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.&#10;&#10;“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to&#10;rain; and then you must stay all night.”&#10;&#10;“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that&#10;they would not offer to send her home.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton,&#10;and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”&#10;&#10;“I had much rather go in the coach.”&#10;&#10;“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are&#10;wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”&#10;&#10;“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”&#10;&#10;“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose&#10;will be answered.”&#10;&#10;She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses&#10;were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her&#10;mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a&#10;bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before&#10;it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was&#10;delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;&#10;Jane certainly could not come back.&#10;&#10;“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than&#10;once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the&#10;next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her&#10;contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield&#10;brought the following note for Elizabeth:&#10;&#10;“MY DEAREST LIZZY,--&#10;&#10;“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be&#10;imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not&#10;hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.&#10;Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been&#10;to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the&#10;matter with me.--Yours, etc.”&#10;&#10;“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note&#10;aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she&#10;should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of&#10;Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling&#10;colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is&#10;all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though&#10;the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking&#10;was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.&#10;&#10;“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a&#10;thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get&#10;there.”&#10;&#10;“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”&#10;&#10;“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the&#10;horses?”&#10;&#10;“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing&#10;when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”&#10;&#10;“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every&#10;impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,&#10;exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”&#10;&#10;“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.&#10;Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off&#10;together.&#10;&#10;“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may&#10;see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”&#10;&#10;In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one&#10;of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing&#10;field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing&#10;over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last&#10;within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face&#10;glowing with the warmth of exercise.&#10;&#10;She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were&#10;assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.&#10;That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such&#10;dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and&#10;Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt&#10;for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their&#10;brother’s manners there was something better than politeness; there&#10;was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.&#10;Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the&#10;brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as&#10;to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was&#10;thinking only of his breakfast.&#10;&#10;Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss&#10;Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not&#10;well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her&#10;immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving&#10;alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed&#10;for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,&#10;however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them&#10;together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the&#10;extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended&#10;her.&#10;&#10;When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth&#10;began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and&#10;solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having&#10;examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught&#10;a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;&#10;advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice&#10;was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head&#10;ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were&#10;the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in&#10;fact, nothing to do elsewhere.&#10;&#10;When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very&#10;unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only&#10;wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern&#10;in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer&#10;of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.&#10;Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to&#10;Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply&#10;of clothes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 8&#10;&#10;&#10;At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six&#10;Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then&#10;poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the&#10;much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a very&#10;favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing&#10;this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how&#10;shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked&#10;being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their&#10;indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored&#10;Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.&#10;&#10;Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could&#10;regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his&#10;attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling&#10;herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the&#10;others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was&#10;engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.&#10;Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to&#10;eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain&#10;dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.&#10;&#10;When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley&#10;began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were&#10;pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;&#10;she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the&#10;same, and added:&#10;&#10;“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent&#10;walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really&#10;looked almost wild.”&#10;&#10;“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very&#10;nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the&#10;country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”&#10;&#10;“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep&#10;in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to&#10;hide it not doing its office.”&#10;&#10;“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was&#10;all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably&#10;well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite&#10;escaped my notice.”&#10;&#10;“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am&#10;inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such&#10;an exhibition.”&#10;&#10;“Certainly not.”&#10;&#10;“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,&#10;above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by&#10;it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,&#10;a most country-town indifference to decorum.”&#10;&#10;“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said&#10;Bingley.&#10;&#10;“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that&#10;this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”&#10;&#10;“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A&#10;short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:&#10;&#10;“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very&#10;sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with&#10;such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is&#10;no chance of it.”&#10;&#10;“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in&#10;Meryton.”&#10;&#10;“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”&#10;&#10;“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.&#10;&#10;“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it&#10;would not make them one jot less agreeable.”&#10;&#10;“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any&#10;consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.&#10;&#10;To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their&#10;hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of&#10;their dear friend’s vulgar relations.&#10;&#10;With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on&#10;leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.&#10;She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till&#10;late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and&#10;when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go&#10;downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole&#10;party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting&#10;them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the&#10;excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay&#10;below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.&#10;&#10;“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”&#10;&#10;“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great&#10;reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”&#10;&#10;“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am&#10;_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”&#10;&#10;“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and&#10;I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the&#10;table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her&#10;others--all that his library afforded.&#10;&#10;“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own&#10;credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more&#10;than I ever looked into.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those&#10;in the room.&#10;&#10;“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left&#10;so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at&#10;Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”&#10;&#10;“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many&#10;generations.”&#10;&#10;“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying&#10;books.”&#10;&#10;“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as&#10;these.”&#10;&#10;“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of&#10;that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be&#10;half as delightful as Pemberley.”&#10;&#10;“I wish it may.”&#10;&#10;“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that&#10;neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a&#10;finer county in England than Derbyshire.”&#10;&#10;“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”&#10;&#10;“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”&#10;&#10;“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get&#10;Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very&#10;little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew&#10;near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his&#10;eldest sister, to observe the game.&#10;&#10;“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will&#10;she be as tall as I am?”&#10;&#10;“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or&#10;rather taller.”&#10;&#10;“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me&#10;so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished&#10;for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”&#10;&#10;“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience&#10;to be so very accomplished as they all are.”&#10;&#10;“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and&#10;net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure&#10;I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being&#10;informed that she was very accomplished.”&#10;&#10;“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has&#10;too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no&#10;otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very&#10;far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I&#10;cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my&#10;acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”&#10;&#10;“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.&#10;&#10;“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your&#10;idea of an accomplished woman.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really&#10;esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met&#10;with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,&#10;dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides&#10;all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of&#10;walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word&#10;will be but half-deserved.”&#10;&#10;“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must&#10;yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by&#10;extensive reading.”&#10;&#10;“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.&#10;I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”&#10;&#10;“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all&#10;this?”&#10;&#10;“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and&#10;application, and elegance, as you describe united.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her&#10;implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who&#10;answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with&#10;bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all&#10;conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the&#10;room.&#10;&#10;“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,&#10;“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the&#10;other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it&#10;succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”&#10;&#10;“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,&#10;“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend&#10;to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is&#10;despicable.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to&#10;continue the subject.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and&#10;that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for&#10;immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could&#10;be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most&#10;eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so&#10;unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled&#10;that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet&#10;were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters&#10;declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,&#10;however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief&#10;to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every&#10;attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 9&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the&#10;morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the&#10;inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,&#10;and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his&#10;sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a&#10;note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her&#10;own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and&#10;its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her&#10;two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.&#10;&#10;Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been&#10;very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was&#10;not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her&#10;restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She&#10;would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried&#10;home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think&#10;it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss&#10;Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all&#10;attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes&#10;that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.&#10;&#10;“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be&#10;moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass&#10;a little longer on your kindness.”&#10;&#10;“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am&#10;sure, will not hear of her removal.”&#10;&#10;“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,&#10;“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she&#10;remains with us.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.&#10;&#10;“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not&#10;know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers&#10;a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is&#10;always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest&#10;temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are&#10;nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a&#10;charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the&#10;country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it&#10;in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”&#10;&#10;“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I&#10;should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five&#10;minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”&#10;&#10;“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.&#10;&#10;“Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”&#10;&#10;“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen&#10;through I am afraid is pitiful.”&#10;&#10;“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate&#10;character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”&#10;&#10;“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in&#10;the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”&#10;&#10;“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a&#10;studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at&#10;least that advantage.”&#10;&#10;“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for&#10;such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and&#10;unvarying society.”&#10;&#10;“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be&#10;observed in them for ever.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning&#10;a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_&#10;going on in the country as in town.”&#10;&#10;Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,&#10;turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete&#10;victory over him, continued her triumph.&#10;&#10;“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for&#10;my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal&#10;pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”&#10;&#10;“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;&#10;and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their&#10;advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”&#10;&#10;“Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that&#10;gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing&#10;at all.”&#10;&#10;“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her&#10;mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not&#10;such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,&#10;which you must acknowledge to be true.”&#10;&#10;“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting&#10;with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few&#10;neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”&#10;&#10;Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his&#10;countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards&#10;Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of&#10;saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if&#10;Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.&#10;&#10;“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir&#10;William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So&#10;genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_&#10;is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very&#10;important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”&#10;&#10;“Did Charlotte dine with you?”&#10;&#10;“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For&#10;my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;&#10;_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to&#10;judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,&#10;I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think&#10;Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”&#10;&#10;“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself&#10;has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast&#10;of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody&#10;better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own&#10;partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother&#10;Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was&#10;sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he&#10;did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses&#10;on her, and very pretty they were.”&#10;&#10;“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has&#10;been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first&#10;discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”&#10;&#10;“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.&#10;&#10;“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is&#10;strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I&#10;am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”&#10;&#10;Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth&#10;tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to&#10;speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.&#10;Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to&#10;Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was&#10;unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be&#10;civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part&#10;indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and&#10;soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of&#10;her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to&#10;each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the&#10;youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming&#10;into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.&#10;&#10;Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion&#10;and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose&#10;affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high&#10;animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the&#10;attention of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners, and her own&#10;easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very&#10;equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and&#10;abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most&#10;shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this&#10;sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:&#10;&#10;“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when&#10;your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of&#10;the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”&#10;&#10;Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better to&#10;wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter&#10;would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she&#10;added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel&#10;Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned&#10;instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the&#10;remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,&#10;could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of&#10;all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 10&#10;&#10;&#10;The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss&#10;Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who&#10;continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined&#10;their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.&#10;Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching&#10;the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by&#10;messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and&#10;Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in&#10;attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual&#10;commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness&#10;of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern&#10;with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was&#10;exactly in union with her opinion of each.&#10;&#10;“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”&#10;&#10;He made no answer.&#10;&#10;“You write uncommonly fast.”&#10;&#10;“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”&#10;&#10;“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a&#10;year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”&#10;&#10;“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”&#10;&#10;“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”&#10;&#10;“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”&#10;&#10;“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend&#10;pens remarkably well.”&#10;&#10;“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”&#10;&#10;“How can you contrive to write so even?”&#10;&#10;He was silent.&#10;&#10;“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;&#10;and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful&#10;little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss&#10;Grantley’s.”&#10;&#10;“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At&#10;present I have not room to do them justice.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you&#10;always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”&#10;&#10;“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me&#10;to determine.”&#10;&#10;“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with&#10;ease, cannot write ill.”&#10;&#10;“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her&#10;brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for&#10;words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”&#10;&#10;“My style of writing is very different from yours.”&#10;&#10;“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way&#10;imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”&#10;&#10;“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which&#10;means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”&#10;&#10;“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”&#10;&#10;“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of&#10;humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an&#10;indirect boast.”&#10;&#10;“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”&#10;&#10;“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in&#10;writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of&#10;thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you&#10;think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with&#10;quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any&#10;attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.&#10;Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield&#10;you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of&#10;panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very&#10;laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business&#10;undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”&#10;&#10;“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the&#10;foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,&#10;I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this&#10;moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless&#10;precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”&#10;&#10;“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that&#10;you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as&#10;dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were&#10;mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better&#10;stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably not&#10;go--and at another word, might stay a month.”&#10;&#10;“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did&#10;not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much&#10;more than he did himself.”&#10;&#10;“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my&#10;friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am&#10;afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means&#10;intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a&#10;circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I&#10;could.”&#10;&#10;“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions&#10;as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”&#10;&#10;“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for&#10;himself.”&#10;&#10;“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,&#10;but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to&#10;stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,&#10;that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and&#10;the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering&#10;one argument in favour of its propriety.”&#10;&#10;“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit&#10;with you.”&#10;&#10;“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of&#10;either.”&#10;&#10;“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of&#10;friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make&#10;one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason&#10;one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have&#10;supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the&#10;circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour&#10;thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,&#10;where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no&#10;very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying&#10;with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”&#10;&#10;“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to&#10;arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to&#10;appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting&#10;between the parties?”&#10;&#10;“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not&#10;forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more&#10;weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure&#10;you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with&#10;myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not&#10;know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in&#10;particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,&#10;when he has nothing to do.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was&#10;rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly&#10;resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her&#10;brother for talking such nonsense.&#10;&#10;“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,&#10;and want to silence this.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss&#10;Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very&#10;thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”&#10;&#10;“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.&#10;Darcy had much better finish his letter.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.&#10;&#10;When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth&#10;for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity&#10;to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead&#10;the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she&#10;seated herself.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,&#10;Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books&#10;that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed&#10;on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of&#10;admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her&#10;because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,&#10;however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something&#10;more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in&#10;any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked&#10;him too little to care for his approbation.&#10;&#10;After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by&#10;a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near&#10;Elizabeth, said to her:&#10;&#10;“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an&#10;opportunity of dancing a reel?”&#10;&#10;She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some&#10;surprise at her silence.&#10;&#10;“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately&#10;determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’&#10;that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always&#10;delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of&#10;their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell&#10;you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if&#10;you dare.”&#10;&#10;“Indeed I do not dare.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his&#10;gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her&#10;manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy&#10;had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really&#10;believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he&#10;should be in some danger.&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great&#10;anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some&#10;assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of&#10;their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.&#10;&#10;“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery&#10;the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this&#10;desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;&#10;and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after&#10;officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to&#10;check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,&#10;which your lady possesses.”&#10;&#10;“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”&#10;&#10;“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed&#10;in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the&#10;judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different&#10;lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for&#10;what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”&#10;&#10;“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their&#10;colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be&#10;copied.”&#10;&#10;At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and&#10;Elizabeth herself.&#10;&#10;“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some&#10;confusion, lest they had been overheard.&#10;&#10;“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without&#10;telling us that you were coming out.”&#10;&#10;Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk&#10;by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,&#10;and immediately said:&#10;&#10;“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the&#10;avenue.”&#10;&#10;But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,&#10;laughingly answered:&#10;&#10;“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear&#10;to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a&#10;fourth. Good-bye.”&#10;&#10;She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of&#10;being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered&#10;as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 11&#10;&#10;&#10;When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her&#10;sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the&#10;drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many&#10;professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable&#10;as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.&#10;Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an&#10;entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh&#10;at their acquaintance with spirit.&#10;&#10;But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;&#10;Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had&#10;something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed&#10;himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also&#10;made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness&#10;and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and&#10;attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she&#10;should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire&#10;to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from&#10;the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone&#10;else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great&#10;delight.&#10;&#10;When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the&#10;card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.&#10;Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open&#10;petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and&#10;the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.&#10;Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the&#10;sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;&#10;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets&#10;and rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss&#10;Bennet.&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.&#10;Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she&#10;was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She&#10;could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her&#10;question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be&#10;amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the&#10;second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant&#10;it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no&#10;enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a&#10;book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not&#10;an excellent library.”&#10;&#10;No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and&#10;cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing&#10;her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly&#10;towards him and said:&#10;&#10;“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at&#10;Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult&#10;the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are&#10;not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a&#10;pleasure.”&#10;&#10;“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he&#10;chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled&#10;thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send&#10;round my cards.”&#10;&#10;“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were&#10;carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably&#10;tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much&#10;more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of&#10;the day.”&#10;&#10;“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be&#10;near so much like a ball.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked&#10;about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but&#10;Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In&#10;the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,&#10;turning to Elizabeth, said:&#10;&#10;“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a&#10;turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so&#10;long in one attitude.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley&#10;succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked&#10;up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as&#10;Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was&#10;directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that&#10;he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down&#10;the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would&#10;interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his&#10;meaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?&#10;&#10;“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe&#10;on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing&#10;about it.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in&#10;anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his&#10;two motives.&#10;&#10;“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon&#10;as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing&#10;the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret&#10;affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures&#10;appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be&#10;completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better&#10;as I sit by the fire.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so&#10;abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”&#10;&#10;“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We&#10;can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate&#10;as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”&#10;&#10;“But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has&#10;not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of&#10;mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will&#10;not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a&#10;subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”&#10;&#10;“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an&#10;uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would&#10;be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a&#10;laugh.”&#10;&#10;“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.&#10;The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their&#10;actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in&#10;life is a joke.”&#10;&#10;“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope I&#10;am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.&#10;Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,&#10;and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely&#10;what you are without.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study&#10;of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong&#10;understanding to ridicule.”&#10;&#10;“Such as vanity and pride.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real&#10;superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.&#10;&#10;“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;&#10;“and pray what is the result?”&#10;&#10;“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it&#10;himself without disguise.”&#10;&#10;“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,&#10;but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch&#10;for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the&#10;convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others&#10;so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings&#10;are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper&#10;would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost&#10;forever.”&#10;&#10;“_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment&#10;_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I&#10;really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”&#10;&#10;“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular&#10;evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”&#10;&#10;“And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”&#10;&#10;“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand&#10;them.”&#10;&#10;“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a&#10;conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my&#10;waking Mr. Hurst?”&#10;&#10;Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was&#10;opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for&#10;it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 12&#10;&#10;&#10;In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the&#10;next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for&#10;them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on&#10;her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which&#10;would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive&#10;them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at&#10;least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.&#10;Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage&#10;before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley&#10;and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them&#10;very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively&#10;resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the&#10;contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,&#10;she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at&#10;length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield&#10;that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.&#10;&#10;The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was&#10;said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work&#10;on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was&#10;then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike&#10;of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.&#10;&#10;The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so&#10;soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be&#10;safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where&#10;she felt herself to be right.&#10;&#10;To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at&#10;Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss&#10;Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.&#10;He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration&#10;should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope&#10;of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been&#10;suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight&#10;in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke&#10;ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were&#10;at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most&#10;conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.&#10;&#10;On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost&#10;all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last&#10;very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,&#10;after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her&#10;to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most&#10;tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of&#10;the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.&#10;&#10;They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet&#10;wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much&#10;trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their&#10;father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really&#10;glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The&#10;evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of&#10;its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and&#10;Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human&#10;nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of&#10;threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information&#10;for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said&#10;in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers&#10;had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it&#10;had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 13&#10;&#10;&#10;“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at&#10;breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,&#10;because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”&#10;&#10;“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,&#10;unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners&#10;are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”&#10;&#10;“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.&#10;Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.&#10;Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be&#10;got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this&#10;moment.”&#10;&#10;“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I&#10;never saw in the whole course of my life.”&#10;&#10;This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being&#10;eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.&#10;&#10;After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:&#10;&#10;“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago&#10;I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring&#10;early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,&#10;may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.&#10;Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing&#10;in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own&#10;children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago&#10;to do something or other about it.”&#10;&#10;Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They&#10;had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which&#10;Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail&#10;bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of&#10;five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.&#10;&#10;“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and&#10;nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.&#10;But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little&#10;softened by his manner of expressing himself.”&#10;&#10;“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of&#10;him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false&#10;friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did&#10;before him?”&#10;&#10;“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that&#10;head, as you will hear.”&#10;&#10;“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.&#10;&#10;“Dear Sir,--&#10;&#10;“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured&#10;father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the&#10;misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but&#10;for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might&#10;seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone&#10;with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--‘There, Mrs.&#10;Bennet.’--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having&#10;received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be&#10;distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de&#10;Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has&#10;preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be&#10;my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her&#10;ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which&#10;are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I&#10;feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in&#10;all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I&#10;flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and&#10;that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate&#10;will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the&#10;offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the&#10;means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for&#10;it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible&#10;amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to&#10;receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting&#10;on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and&#10;shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight&#10;following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine&#10;is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided&#10;that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I&#10;remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and&#10;daughters, your well-wisher and friend,&#10;&#10;“WILLIAM COLLINS”&#10;&#10;“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”&#10; said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most&#10;conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will&#10;prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so&#10;indulgent as to let him come to us again.”&#10;&#10;“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if&#10;he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to&#10;discourage him.”&#10;&#10;“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean&#10;to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his&#10;credit.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady&#10;Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying&#10;his parishioners whenever it were required.&#10;&#10;“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him&#10;out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he&#10;mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he&#10;would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?”&#10;&#10;“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the&#10;reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his&#10;letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”&#10;&#10;“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem&#10;defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I&#10;think it is well expressed.”&#10;&#10;To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any&#10;degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should&#10;come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had&#10;received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for&#10;their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,&#10;and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which&#10;astonished her husband and daughters.&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great&#10;politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the&#10;ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in&#10;need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a&#10;tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and&#10;stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated&#10;before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of&#10;daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this&#10;instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did&#10;not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This&#10;gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.&#10;Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.&#10;&#10;“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may&#10;prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so&#10;oddly.”&#10;&#10;“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”&#10;&#10;“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you&#10;must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things&#10;I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates&#10;will go when once they come to be entailed.”&#10;&#10;“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and&#10;could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing&#10;forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come&#10;prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,&#10;when we are better acquainted--”&#10;&#10;He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each&#10;other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The&#10;hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;&#10;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s&#10;heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his&#10;own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and&#10;he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its&#10;cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who&#10;assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a&#10;good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He&#10;begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared&#10;herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a&#10;quarter of an hour.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 14&#10;&#10;&#10;During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants&#10;were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his&#10;guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to&#10;shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady&#10;Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for&#10;his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen&#10;better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him&#10;to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect&#10;he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in&#10;a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself&#10;experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to&#10;approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of&#10;preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,&#10;and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of&#10;quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many&#10;people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.&#10;She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she&#10;made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the&#10;neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or&#10;two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to&#10;marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had&#10;once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly&#10;approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed&#10;to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.”&#10;&#10;“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and&#10;I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies&#10;in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”&#10;&#10;“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane&#10;from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”&#10;&#10;“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”&#10;&#10;“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very&#10;extensive property.”&#10;&#10;“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than&#10;many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”&#10;&#10;“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says&#10;that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the&#10;handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks&#10;the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly&#10;constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many&#10;accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am&#10;informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still&#10;resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends&#10;to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”&#10;&#10;“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at&#10;court.”&#10;&#10;“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;&#10;and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the&#10;British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased&#10;with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to&#10;offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable&#10;to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that&#10;her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most&#10;elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by&#10;her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and&#10;it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to&#10;pay.”&#10;&#10;“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you&#10;that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask&#10;whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the&#10;moment, or are the result of previous study?”&#10;&#10;“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I&#10;sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant&#10;compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to&#10;give them as unstudied an air as possible.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd&#10;as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,&#10;maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,&#10;and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner&#10;in his pleasure.&#10;&#10;By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad&#10;to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,&#10;glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily&#10;assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything&#10;announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and&#10;begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at&#10;him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some&#10;deliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the&#10;volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three&#10;pages, she interrupted him with:&#10;&#10;“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away&#10;Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me&#10;so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more&#10;about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”&#10;&#10;Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.&#10;Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:&#10;&#10;“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books&#10;of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes&#10;me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to&#10;them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”&#10;&#10;Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at&#10;backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted&#10;very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.&#10;Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia’s&#10;interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would&#10;resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his&#10;young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any&#10;affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared&#10;for backgammon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 15&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had&#10;been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part&#10;of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and&#10;miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he&#10;had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful&#10;acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had&#10;given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a&#10;good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in&#10;retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected&#10;prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de&#10;Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which&#10;he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,&#10;mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a&#10;clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of&#10;pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.&#10;&#10;Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to&#10;marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had&#10;a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found&#10;them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.&#10;This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s&#10;estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and&#10;suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own&#10;part.&#10;&#10;His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face&#10;confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what&#10;was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled&#10;choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a&#10;quarter of an hour’s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a&#10;conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally&#10;to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at&#10;Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general&#10;encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to&#10;her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could&#10;not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her&#10;_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her&#10;to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon&#10;done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally&#10;next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have&#10;two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of&#10;the day before was now high in her good graces.&#10;&#10;Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister&#10;except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,&#10;at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,&#10;and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed&#10;him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with&#10;one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.&#10;Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such&#10;doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been&#10;always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told&#10;Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the&#10;house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,&#10;was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their&#10;walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker&#10;than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.&#10;&#10;In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his&#10;cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of&#10;the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were&#10;immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and&#10;nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in&#10;a shop window, could recall them.&#10;&#10;But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom&#10;they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking&#10;with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was&#10;the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came&#10;to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the&#10;stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,&#10;determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under&#10;pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately&#10;had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had&#10;reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated&#10;permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with&#10;him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a&#10;commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the&#10;young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.&#10;His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of&#10;beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.&#10;The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness&#10;of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and&#10;unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together&#10;very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy&#10;and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the&#10;ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and&#10;began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and&#10;Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to&#10;Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated&#10;it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes&#10;on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the&#10;stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they&#10;looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.&#10;Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,&#10;after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just&#10;deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to&#10;imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.&#10;&#10;In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what&#10;passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.&#10;&#10;Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of&#10;Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s&#10;pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of&#10;Mrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the&#10;invitation.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,&#10;from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was&#10;eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as&#10;their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing&#10;about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the&#10;street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to&#10;Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility&#10;was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She&#10;received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with&#10;as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous&#10;acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,&#10;however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who&#10;introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an&#10;excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon&#10;put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,&#10;however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that&#10;Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a&#10;lieutenant’s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the&#10;last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.&#10;Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the&#10;occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the&#10;officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,&#10;disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses&#10;the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.&#10;Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn&#10;would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips&#10;protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery&#10;tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such&#10;delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.&#10;Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured&#10;with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.&#10;&#10;As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass&#10;between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either&#10;or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain&#10;such behaviour than her sister.&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring&#10;Mrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady&#10;Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;&#10;for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even&#10;pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although&#10;utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be&#10;attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so&#10;much attention in the whole course of his life.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 16&#10;&#10;&#10;As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their&#10;aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for&#10;a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach&#10;conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and&#10;the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,&#10;that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in&#10;the house.&#10;&#10;When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.&#10;Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much&#10;struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he&#10;might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast&#10;parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much&#10;gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what&#10;Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the&#10;description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found&#10;that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all&#10;the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison&#10;with the housekeeper’s room.&#10;&#10;In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,&#10;with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and&#10;the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the&#10;gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive&#10;listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she&#10;heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as&#10;soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,&#10;and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine&#10;their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the&#10;interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.&#10;The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,&#10;Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking&#10;of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.&#10;The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,&#10;gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but&#10;Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and&#10;walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,&#10;breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.&#10;&#10;Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was&#10;turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated&#10;himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into&#10;conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel&#10;that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered&#10;interesting by the skill of the speaker.&#10;&#10;With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the&#10;officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young&#10;ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind&#10;listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly&#10;supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he&#10;had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.&#10;&#10;“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad&#10;to improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very&#10;glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.&#10;&#10;Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he&#10;received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there&#10;seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most&#10;determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,&#10;she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets&#10;and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.&#10;Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore&#10;at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear&#10;him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be&#10;told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not&#10;even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly&#10;relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far&#10;Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in&#10;a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.&#10;&#10;“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject&#10;drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I&#10;understand.”&#10;&#10;“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear&#10;ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more&#10;capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for&#10;I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my&#10;infancy.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could not but look surprised.&#10;&#10;“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after&#10;seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting&#10;yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”&#10;&#10;“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have&#10;spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very&#10;disagreeable.”&#10;&#10;“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being&#10;agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him&#10;too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_&#10;to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general&#10;astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly&#10;anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”&#10;&#10;“Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in&#10;the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in&#10;Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find&#10;him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”&#10;&#10;“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short&#10;interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond&#10;their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The&#10;world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his&#10;high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”&#10;&#10;“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an&#10;ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.&#10;&#10;“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is&#10;likely to be in this country much longer.”&#10;&#10;“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I&#10;was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will&#10;not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_&#10;wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,&#10;and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for&#10;avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense&#10;of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he&#10;is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men&#10;that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never&#10;be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by&#10;a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been&#10;scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and&#10;everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the&#10;memory of his father.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with&#10;all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.&#10;&#10;Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the&#10;neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that&#10;he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very&#10;intelligible gallantry.&#10;&#10;“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,&#10;“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be&#10;a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me&#10;further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great&#10;attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.&#10;Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and&#10;my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.&#10;A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have&#10;now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I&#10;was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in&#10;possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we&#10;were speaking of just now.”&#10;&#10;“Indeed!”&#10;&#10;“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best&#10;living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.&#10;I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,&#10;and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given&#10;elsewhere.”&#10;&#10;“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his&#10;will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”&#10;&#10;“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to&#10;give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the&#10;intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely&#10;conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim&#10;to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain&#10;it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was&#10;of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no&#10;less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done&#10;anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and&#10;I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can&#10;recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort&#10;of men, and that he hates me.”&#10;&#10;“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”&#10;&#10;“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I&#10;can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than&#10;ever as he expressed them.&#10;&#10;“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can&#10;have induced him to behave so cruelly?”&#10;&#10;“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but&#10;attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me&#10;less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon&#10;attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had&#10;not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort&#10;of preference which was often given me.”&#10;&#10;“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked&#10;him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be&#10;despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of&#10;descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as&#10;this.”&#10;&#10;After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_&#10;remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of&#10;his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition&#10;must be dreadful.”&#10;&#10;“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly&#10;be just to him.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To&#10;treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his&#10;father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very&#10;countenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself&#10;with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,&#10;connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”&#10;&#10;“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest&#10;part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,&#10;sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_&#10;father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,&#10;appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of&#10;use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the&#10;Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most&#10;intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to&#10;be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence,&#10;and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a&#10;voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to&#10;be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.”&#10;&#10;“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very&#10;pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better&#10;motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for&#10;dishonesty I must call it.”&#10;&#10;“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may&#10;be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has&#10;connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are&#10;none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger&#10;impulses even than pride.”&#10;&#10;“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”&#10;&#10;“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money&#10;freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the&#10;poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what&#10;his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,&#10;to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the&#10;Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,&#10;which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and&#10;careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up&#10;as the most attentive and best of brothers.”&#10;&#10;“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”&#10;&#10;He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to&#10;speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very&#10;proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond&#10;of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is&#10;nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,&#10;and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death, her&#10;home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her&#10;education.”&#10;&#10;After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not&#10;help reverting once more to the first, and saying:&#10;&#10;“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,&#10;who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,&#10;be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you&#10;know Mr. Bingley?”&#10;&#10;“Not at all.”&#10;&#10;“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.&#10;Darcy is.”&#10;&#10;“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not&#10;want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth&#10;his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is&#10;a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His&#10;pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,&#10;sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something&#10;for fortune and figure.”&#10;&#10;The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round&#10;the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin&#10;Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were&#10;made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every&#10;point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,&#10;he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least&#10;importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged&#10;that she would not make herself uneasy.&#10;&#10;“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a&#10;card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I&#10;am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There&#10;are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady&#10;Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding&#10;little matters.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for&#10;a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation&#10;was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.&#10;&#10;“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him&#10;a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her&#10;notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”&#10;&#10;“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy&#10;were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”&#10;&#10;“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s&#10;connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before&#10;yesterday.”&#10;&#10;“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is&#10;believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”&#10;&#10;This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss&#10;Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her&#10;affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already&#10;self-destined for another.&#10;&#10;“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her&#10;daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,&#10;I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his&#10;patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”&#10;&#10;“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have&#10;not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked&#10;her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the&#10;reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe&#10;she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from&#10;her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her&#10;nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an&#10;understanding of the first class.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and&#10;they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper&#10;put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.&#10;Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise&#10;of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to&#10;everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done&#10;gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could&#10;think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all&#10;the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name&#10;as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia&#10;talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the&#10;fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and&#10;Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses&#10;at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing&#10;that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage&#10;before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 17&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.&#10;Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she&#10;knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.&#10;Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the&#10;veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The&#10;possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to&#10;interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be&#10;done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,&#10;and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be&#10;otherwise explained.&#10;&#10;“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way&#10;or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps&#10;misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to&#10;conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,&#10;without actual blame on either side.”&#10;&#10;“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on&#10;behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the&#10;business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of&#10;somebody.”&#10;&#10;“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my&#10;opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light&#10;it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such&#10;a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is&#10;impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his&#10;character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so&#10;excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”&#10;&#10;“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on, than&#10;that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me&#10;last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it&#10;be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his&#10;looks.”&#10;&#10;“It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to&#10;think.”&#10;&#10;“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”&#10;&#10;But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,&#10;if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair&#10;became public.&#10;&#10;The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this&#10;conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had&#10;been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal&#10;invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed&#10;for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their&#10;dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly&#10;asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To&#10;the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet&#10;as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to&#10;the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an&#10;activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if&#10;eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.&#10;&#10;The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every&#10;female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in&#10;compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered&#10;by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a&#10;ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the&#10;society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and&#10;Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.&#10;Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look&#10;and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended&#10;less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they&#10;each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,&#10;he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball&#10;was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she&#10;had no disinclination for it.&#10;&#10;“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough--I&#10;think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.&#10;Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those&#10;who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for&#10;everybody.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did&#10;not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking&#10;him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if&#10;he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s&#10;amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no&#10;scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke&#10;either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to&#10;dance.&#10;&#10;“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball&#10;of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,&#10;can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing&#10;myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair&#10;cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of&#10;soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,&#10;a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right&#10;cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being&#10;engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins&#10;instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help&#10;for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own were perforce&#10;delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as&#10;good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his&#10;gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first&#10;struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy&#10;of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a&#10;quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.&#10;The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing&#10;civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a&#10;compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than&#10;gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before&#10;her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage&#10;was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose&#10;to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the&#10;consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and&#10;till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.&#10;&#10;If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the&#10;younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this&#10;time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there&#10;was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton&#10;once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very&#10;shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have&#10;found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the&#10;improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than&#10;a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and&#10;Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 18&#10;&#10;&#10;Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in&#10;vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a&#10;doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty&#10;of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that&#10;might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than&#10;usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all&#10;that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than&#10;might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose&#10;the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s&#10;pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though&#10;this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was&#10;pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who&#10;told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the&#10;day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,&#10;“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if&#10;he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”&#10;&#10;This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by&#10;Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for&#10;Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every&#10;feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate&#10;disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to&#10;the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.&#10;Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She&#10;was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away&#10;with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in&#10;speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.&#10;&#10;But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect&#10;of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her&#10;spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had&#10;not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition&#10;to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular&#10;notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;&#10;they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,&#10;apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being&#10;aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable&#10;partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from&#10;him was ecstasy.&#10;&#10;She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of&#10;Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances&#10;were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with&#10;her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took&#10;her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,&#10;without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again&#10;immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of&#10;mind; Charlotte tried to console her:&#10;&#10;“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”&#10;&#10;“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find&#10;a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an&#10;evil.”&#10;&#10;When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her&#10;hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a&#10;simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant&#10;in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no&#10;answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which&#10;she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and&#10;reading in her neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding&#10;it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to&#10;imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at&#10;first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would&#10;be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made&#10;some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again&#10;silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time&#10;with:--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked&#10;about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size&#10;of the room, or the number of couples.”&#10;&#10;He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be&#10;said.&#10;&#10;“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may&#10;observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But&#10;_now_ we may be silent.”&#10;&#10;“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”&#10;&#10;“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be&#10;entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of&#10;_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the&#10;trouble of saying as little as possible.”&#10;&#10;“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you&#10;imagine that you are gratifying mine?”&#10;&#10;“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great&#10;similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,&#10;taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say&#10;something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to&#10;posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”&#10;&#10;“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”&#10; said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_&#10;think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”&#10;&#10;“I must not decide on my own performance.”&#10;&#10;He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down&#10;the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often&#10;walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist&#10;the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just&#10;been forming a new acquaintance.”&#10;&#10;The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his&#10;features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself&#10;for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a&#10;constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners&#10;as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of&#10;_retaining_ them, is less certain.”&#10;&#10;“He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied Elizabeth&#10;with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all&#10;his life.”&#10;&#10;Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At&#10;that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass&#10;through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.&#10;Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on&#10;his dancing and his partner.&#10;&#10;“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very&#10;superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the&#10;first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not&#10;disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,&#10;especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at&#10;her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then&#10;flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You&#10;will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that&#10;young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”&#10;&#10;The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir&#10;William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his&#10;eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and&#10;Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,&#10;he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made&#10;me forget what we were talking of.”&#10;&#10;“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have&#10;interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.&#10;We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we&#10;are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”&#10;&#10;“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.&#10;&#10;“Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same&#10;feelings.”&#10;&#10;“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be&#10;no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”&#10;&#10;“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of&#10;something else.”&#10;&#10;“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,&#10;with a look of doubt.&#10;&#10;“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her&#10;thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared&#10;by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,&#10;that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was&#10;unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being&#10;created_.”&#10;&#10;“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.&#10;&#10;“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”&#10;&#10;“I hope not.”&#10;&#10;“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,&#10;to be secure of judging properly at first.”&#10;&#10;“May I ask to what these questions tend?”&#10;&#10;“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring&#10;to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”&#10;&#10;“And what is your success?”&#10;&#10;She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different&#10;accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”&#10;&#10;“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary&#10;greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were&#10;not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to&#10;fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”&#10;&#10;“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another&#10;opportunity.”&#10;&#10;“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.&#10;She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in&#10;silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,&#10;for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards&#10;her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against&#10;another.&#10;&#10;They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and&#10;with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:&#10;&#10;“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!&#10;Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand&#10;questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among&#10;his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late&#10;Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to&#10;give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s&#10;using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has&#10;always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated&#10;Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but&#10;I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he&#10;cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother&#10;thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to&#10;the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself&#10;out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent&#10;thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,&#10;Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really,&#10;considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”&#10;&#10;“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said&#10;Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse&#10;than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can&#10;assure you, he informed me himself.”&#10;&#10;“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.&#10;“Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.”&#10;&#10;“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken&#10;if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see&#10;nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.&#10;Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make&#10;inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of&#10;such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently&#10;marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.&#10;Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for&#10;Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way&#10;before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.&#10;&#10;“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her&#10;sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have&#10;been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case&#10;you may be sure of my pardon.”&#10;&#10;“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing&#10;satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of&#10;his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have&#10;principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,&#10;the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that&#10;Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has&#10;received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister’s,&#10;Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has&#10;been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”&#10;&#10;“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”&#10;&#10;“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”&#10;&#10;“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am&#10;satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”&#10;&#10;“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard&#10;them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to&#10;him _conditionally_ only.”&#10;&#10;“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;&#10;“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.&#10;Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but&#10;since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt&#10;the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of&#10;both gentlemen as I did before.”&#10;&#10;She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on&#10;which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with&#10;delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.&#10;Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence&#10;in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew&#10;to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last&#10;partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,&#10;and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as&#10;to make a most important discovery.&#10;&#10;“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now&#10;in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the&#10;gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of&#10;the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady&#10;Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have&#10;thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de&#10;Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made&#10;in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to&#10;do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total&#10;ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”&#10;&#10;“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”&#10;&#10;“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.&#10;I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to&#10;assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him&#10;that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction&#10;as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that&#10;it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either&#10;side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in&#10;consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her&#10;with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she&#10;ceased speaking, replied thus:&#10;&#10;“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in&#10;your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your&#10;understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide&#10;difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,&#10;and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that&#10;I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with&#10;the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of&#10;behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to&#10;follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to&#10;perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to&#10;profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant&#10;guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by&#10;education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young&#10;lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.&#10;Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose&#10;astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced&#10;his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of&#10;it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the&#10;words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed&#10;her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him&#10;with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time&#10;to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,&#10;was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed&#10;abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the&#10;end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.&#10;Collins then returned to Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my&#10;reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered&#10;me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying&#10;that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be&#10;certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very&#10;handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”&#10;&#10;As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned&#10;her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the&#10;train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,&#10;made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in&#10;that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection&#10;could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of&#10;endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts&#10;she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to&#10;venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to&#10;supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which&#10;placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find&#10;that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,&#10;openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon&#10;be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet&#10;seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the&#10;match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but&#10;three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and&#10;then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of&#10;Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as&#10;she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger&#10;daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of&#10;other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be&#10;able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that&#10;she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was&#10;necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on&#10;such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.&#10;Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She&#10;concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally&#10;fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no&#10;chance of it.&#10;&#10;In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s&#10;words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible&#10;whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the&#10;chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her&#10;mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.&#10;&#10;“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am&#10;sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say&#10;nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”&#10;&#10;“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you&#10;to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by&#10;so doing!”&#10;&#10;Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would&#10;talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and&#10;blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently&#10;glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what&#10;she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was&#10;convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression&#10;of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and&#10;steady gravity.&#10;&#10;At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who&#10;had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no&#10;likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and&#10;chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of&#10;tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and&#10;she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,&#10;preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent&#10;entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,&#10;but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of&#10;exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s&#10;eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her&#10;progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very&#10;ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks&#10;of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to&#10;favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.&#10;Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was&#10;weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at&#10;Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to&#10;Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs&#10;of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,&#10;imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his&#10;interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,&#10;and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do&#10;extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other&#10;young ladies have time to exhibit.”&#10;&#10;Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and&#10;Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid&#10;her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.&#10;&#10;“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I&#10;should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an&#10;air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly&#10;compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,&#10;to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time&#10;to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The&#10;rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make&#10;such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not&#10;offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time&#10;that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care&#10;and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making&#10;as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance&#10;that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,&#10;especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit&#10;him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an&#10;occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the&#10;family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had&#10;been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many&#10;smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his&#10;wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,&#10;and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably&#10;clever, good kind of young man.&#10;&#10;To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to&#10;expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would&#10;have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or&#10;finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister&#10;that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his&#10;feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he&#10;must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should&#10;have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,&#10;and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the&#10;gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.&#10;&#10;The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by&#10;Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though&#10;he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her&#10;power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with&#10;somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.&#10;He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;&#10;that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to&#10;her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her&#10;the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed&#10;her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and&#10;good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.&#10;&#10;She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further notice;&#10;though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite&#10;disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the&#10;probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in&#10;it.&#10;&#10;The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by&#10;a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of&#10;an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how&#10;heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her&#10;sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and&#10;were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed&#10;every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a&#10;languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the&#10;long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his&#10;sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and&#10;politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said&#10;nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.&#10;Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the&#10;rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a&#10;silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too&#10;much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,&#10;how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.&#10;&#10;When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly&#10;civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and&#10;addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he&#10;would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without&#10;the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,&#10;and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on&#10;her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next&#10;day for a short time.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the&#10;delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of&#10;settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly&#10;see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four&#10;months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought&#10;with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.&#10;Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the&#10;man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each&#10;was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 19&#10;&#10;&#10;The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his&#10;declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as&#10;his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having&#10;no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at&#10;the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the&#10;observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On&#10;finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,&#10;soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:&#10;&#10;“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,&#10;when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the&#10;course of this morning?”&#10;&#10;Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.&#10;Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy&#10;will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I&#10;want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening&#10;away, when Elizabeth called out:&#10;&#10;“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse&#10;me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am&#10;going away myself.”&#10;&#10;“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon&#10;Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to&#10;escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.&#10;Collins.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment’s&#10;consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it&#10;over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to&#10;conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between&#10;distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as&#10;they were gone, Mr. Collins began.&#10;&#10;“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from&#10;doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You&#10;would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little&#10;unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected&#10;mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the&#10;purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to&#10;dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as&#10;soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of&#10;my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this&#10;subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for&#10;marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design&#10;of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”&#10;&#10;The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away&#10;with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could&#10;not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,&#10;and he continued:&#10;&#10;“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for&#10;every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example&#10;of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will&#10;add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought&#10;to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and&#10;recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling&#10;patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked&#10;too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I&#10;left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was&#10;arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you&#10;must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose&#10;a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,&#10;useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small&#10;income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as&#10;you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the&#10;way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice&#10;and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the&#10;advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond&#10;anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be&#10;acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and&#10;respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general&#10;intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views&#10;were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I&#10;can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that&#10;being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured&#10;father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy&#10;myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that&#10;the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy&#10;event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not&#10;be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and&#10;I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing&#10;remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the&#10;violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and&#10;shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well&#10;aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds&#10;in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s&#10;decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,&#10;therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that&#10;no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”&#10;&#10;It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.&#10;&#10;“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no&#10;answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for&#10;the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of&#10;your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to&#10;decline them.”&#10;&#10;“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the&#10;hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the&#10;man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their&#10;favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a&#10;third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just&#10;said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”&#10;&#10;“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather&#10;extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not&#10;one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so&#10;daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second&#10;time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_&#10;happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who&#10;could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I&#10;am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the&#10;situation.”&#10;&#10;“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins&#10;very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all&#10;disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of&#10;seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your&#10;modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”&#10;&#10;“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You&#10;must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment&#10;of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by&#10;refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.&#10;In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your&#10;feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn&#10;estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may&#10;be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she&#10;thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus&#10;addressed her:&#10;&#10;“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I&#10;shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given&#10;me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I&#10;know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on&#10;the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to&#10;encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the&#10;female character.”&#10;&#10;“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me&#10;exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form&#10;of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as&#10;to convince you of its being one.”&#10;&#10;“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your&#10;refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for&#10;believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is&#10;unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would&#10;be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections&#10;with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are&#10;circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further&#10;consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no&#10;means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your&#10;portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo&#10;the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must&#10;therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,&#10;I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by&#10;suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”&#10;&#10;“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind&#10;of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would&#10;rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you&#10;again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but&#10;to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect&#10;forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant&#10;female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking&#10;the truth from her heart.”&#10;&#10;“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward&#10;gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express&#10;authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of&#10;being acceptable.”&#10;&#10;To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make&#10;no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if&#10;he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering&#10;encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered&#10;in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could&#10;not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 20&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his&#10;successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule&#10;to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open&#10;the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she&#10;entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in&#10;warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins&#10;received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then&#10;proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result&#10;of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the&#10;refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow&#10;from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.&#10;&#10;This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been&#10;glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage&#10;him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,&#10;and could not help saying so.&#10;&#10;“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be&#10;brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very&#10;headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will&#10;_make_ her know it.”&#10;&#10;“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if&#10;she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would&#10;altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who&#10;naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she&#10;actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not&#10;to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of&#10;temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”&#10;&#10;“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is&#10;only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as&#10;good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and&#10;we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”&#10;&#10;She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her&#10;husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you&#10;are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make&#10;Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you&#10;do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them&#10;on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by&#10;her communication.&#10;&#10;“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had&#10;finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”&#10;&#10;“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,&#10;and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”&#10;&#10;“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”&#10;&#10;“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her&#10;marrying him.”&#10;&#10;“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the&#10;library.&#10;&#10;“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for&#10;you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made&#10;you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was.&#10;“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”&#10;&#10;“I have, sir.”&#10;&#10;“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your&#10;accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, or I will never see her again.”&#10;&#10;“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must&#10;be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you&#10;again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again&#10;if you _do_.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,&#10;but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the&#10;affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.&#10;&#10;“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to&#10;_insist_ upon her marrying him.”&#10;&#10;“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.&#10;First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the&#10;present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the&#10;library to myself as soon as may be.”&#10;&#10;Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did&#10;Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;&#10;coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane&#10;in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined&#10;interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and&#10;sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner&#10;varied, however, her determination never did.&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.&#10;He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin&#10;could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other&#10;way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her&#10;deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.&#10;&#10;While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend&#10;the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to&#10;her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such&#10;fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has&#10;made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”&#10;&#10;Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,&#10;who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the&#10;breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on&#10;the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating&#10;her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her&#10;family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone,&#10;“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,&#10;nobody feels for my poor nerves.”&#10;&#10;Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned&#10;as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided&#10;she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it&#10;into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,&#10;you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is&#10;to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep&#10;you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told&#10;you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,&#10;and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking&#10;to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking&#10;to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have&#10;no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it&#10;is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”&#10;&#10;Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that&#10;any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the&#10;irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of&#10;them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with&#10;an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to&#10;the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold&#10;your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation&#10;together.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but&#10;Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,&#10;detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after&#10;herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little&#10;curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending&#10;not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected&#10;conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”&#10;&#10;“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.&#10;Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his&#10;displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation&#10;to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a&#10;young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;&#10;and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt&#10;of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;&#10;for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as&#10;when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our&#10;estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect&#10;to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to&#10;your daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the&#10;compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my&#10;behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my&#10;dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all&#10;liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.&#10;My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due&#10;consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_&#10;has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 21&#10;&#10;&#10;The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and&#10;Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily&#10;attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her&#10;mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly&#10;expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,&#10;but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke&#10;to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of&#10;himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose&#10;civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and&#10;especially to her friend.&#10;&#10;The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or ill&#10;health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth&#10;had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did&#10;not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on&#10;Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.&#10;&#10;After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham&#10;were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.&#10;He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their&#10;aunt’s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was&#10;well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged&#10;that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.&#10;&#10;“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet&#10;Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so&#10;many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes&#10;might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”&#10;&#10;She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full&#10;discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly&#10;bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with&#10;them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to&#10;her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the&#10;compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an&#10;occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.&#10;&#10;Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came&#10;from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,&#10;hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and&#10;Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw&#10;her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected&#10;herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual&#10;cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety&#10;on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no&#10;sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane&#10;invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,&#10;Jane, taking out the letter, said:&#10;&#10;“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good&#10;deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on&#10;their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You&#10;shall hear what she says.”&#10;&#10;She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information&#10;of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,&#10;and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a&#10;house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything&#10;I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;&#10;but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that&#10;delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may&#10;lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved&#10;correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these highflown&#10;expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;&#10;and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw&#10;nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their&#10;absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as&#10;to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to&#10;regard it, in the enjoyment of his.&#10;&#10;“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be&#10;able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not&#10;hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks&#10;forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful&#10;intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater&#10;satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by&#10;them.”&#10;&#10;“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into&#10;Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”&#10;&#10;“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which&#10;took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we&#10;are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when&#10;Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have&#10;determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend&#10;his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are&#10;already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my&#10;dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of&#10;that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may&#10;abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your&#10;beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the&#10;three of whom we shall deprive you.”&#10;&#10;“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this&#10;winter.”&#10;&#10;“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.”&#10;&#10;“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own&#10;master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which&#10;particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”&#10;&#10;“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,&#10;_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think&#10;Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;&#10;and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into&#10;something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of&#10;her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before&#10;mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the&#10;country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them&#10;unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have&#10;frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;&#10;her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s&#10;partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most&#10;capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to&#10;favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest&#10;Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness&#10;of so many?”&#10;&#10;“What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she&#10;finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that&#10;Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is&#10;perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she&#10;suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to&#10;put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”&#10;&#10;“Most willingly.”&#10;&#10;“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is&#10;in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him&#10;to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he&#10;does not care about you.”&#10;&#10;Jane shook her head.&#10;&#10;“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you&#10;together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She&#10;is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.&#10;Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the&#10;case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she&#10;is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion&#10;that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble&#10;in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and&#10;I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,&#10;my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley&#10;tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest&#10;degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on&#10;Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead&#10;of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”&#10;&#10;“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your&#10;representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the&#10;foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving&#10;anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving&#10;herself.”&#10;&#10;“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you&#10;will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.&#10;You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”&#10;&#10;“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in&#10;accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry&#10;elsewhere?”&#10;&#10;“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature&#10;deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is&#10;more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by&#10;all means to refuse him.”&#10;&#10;“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that&#10;though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could&#10;not hesitate.”&#10;&#10;“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider&#10;your situation with much compassion.”&#10;&#10;“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be&#10;required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”&#10;&#10;The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost&#10;contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s&#10;interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those&#10;wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man&#10;so totally independent of everyone.&#10;&#10;She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt&#10;on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.&#10;Jane’s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,&#10;though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that&#10;Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.&#10;&#10;They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the&#10;family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;&#10;but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,&#10;and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen&#10;to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After&#10;lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.&#10;Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the&#10;conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had&#10;been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two&#10;full courses.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 22&#10;&#10;&#10;The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the&#10;chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.&#10;Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good&#10;humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”&#10; Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and&#10;that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was&#10;very amiable, but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth&#10;had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her&#10;from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards&#10;herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so&#10;favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost&#10;secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very&#10;soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his&#10;character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next&#10;morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw&#10;himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,&#10;from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to&#10;conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known&#10;till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost&#10;secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,&#10;he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.&#10;His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas&#10;perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and&#10;instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had&#10;she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.&#10;&#10;In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,&#10;everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as&#10;they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that&#10;was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must&#10;be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with&#10;his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must&#10;guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its&#10;continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure&#10;and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that&#10;establishment were gained.&#10;&#10;Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;&#10;and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present&#10;circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom&#10;they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were&#10;exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more&#10;interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer&#10;Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided&#10;opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the&#10;Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife&#10;should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole family, in short,&#10;were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes&#10;of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have&#10;done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte’s&#10;dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had&#10;gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were&#10;in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible&#10;nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must&#10;be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly&#10;either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was&#10;the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,&#10;and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest&#10;preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at&#10;the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all&#10;the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business&#10;was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship&#10;she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,&#10;and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be&#10;shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved&#10;to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,&#10;when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had&#10;passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very&#10;dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the&#10;curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct&#10;questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was&#10;at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to&#10;publish his prosperous love.&#10;&#10;As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the&#10;family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved&#10;for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,&#10;said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever&#10;his engagements might allow him to visit them.&#10;&#10;“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly&#10;gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and&#10;you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as&#10;possible.”&#10;&#10;They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for&#10;so speedy a return, immediately said:&#10;&#10;“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my&#10;good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of&#10;offending your patroness.”&#10;&#10;“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you&#10;for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so&#10;material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”&#10;&#10;“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her&#10;displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us&#10;again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,&#10;and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”&#10;&#10;“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such&#10;affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive&#10;from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your&#10;regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though&#10;my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now&#10;take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my&#10;cousin Elizabeth.”&#10;&#10;With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally&#10;surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to&#10;understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her&#10;younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.&#10;She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was&#10;a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no&#10;means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read&#10;and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very&#10;agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this&#10;kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a&#10;private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.&#10;&#10;The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her&#10;friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but&#10;that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from&#10;possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was&#10;consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and&#10;she could not help crying out:&#10;&#10;“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!”&#10;&#10;The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her&#10;story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a&#10;reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained&#10;her composure, and calmly replied:&#10;&#10;“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible&#10;that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,&#10;because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”&#10;&#10;But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort&#10;for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of&#10;their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her&#10;all imaginable happiness.&#10;&#10;“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,&#10;very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry&#10;you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be&#10;satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never&#10;was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins’s&#10;character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my&#10;chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on&#10;entering the marriage state.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,&#10;they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much&#10;longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.&#10;It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so&#10;unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers&#10;of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now&#10;accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was&#10;not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible&#10;that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better&#10;feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a&#10;most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself&#10;and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it&#10;was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had&#10;chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 23&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what&#10;she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention&#10;it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to&#10;announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,&#10;and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the&#10;houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but&#10;incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,&#10;protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and&#10;often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:&#10;&#10;“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know&#10;that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”&#10;&#10;Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne&#10;without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding carried&#10;him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the&#10;truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the&#10;most forbearing courtesy.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant&#10;a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by&#10;mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and&#10;endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters&#10;by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she&#10;was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the&#10;happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character&#10;of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while&#10;Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings&#10;found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving&#10;the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins&#10;had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be&#10;happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two&#10;inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that&#10;Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she&#10;herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two&#10;points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could&#10;console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her&#10;resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without&#10;scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William&#10;or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she&#10;could at all forgive their daughter.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such&#10;as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for&#10;it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had&#10;been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and&#10;more foolish than his daughter!&#10;&#10;Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said&#10;less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;&#10;nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty&#10;and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a&#10;clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news&#10;to spread at Meryton.&#10;&#10;Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort&#10;on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she&#10;called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,&#10;though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been&#10;enough to drive happiness away.&#10;&#10;Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them&#10;mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that&#10;no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her&#10;disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her&#10;sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could&#10;never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,&#10;as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his&#10;return.&#10;&#10;Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting&#10;the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised&#10;letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to&#10;their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a&#10;twelvemonth’s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging&#10;his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many&#10;rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection&#10;of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was&#10;merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready&#10;to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither&#10;he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,&#10;he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take&#10;place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable&#10;argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him&#10;the happiest of men.&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of&#10;pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to&#10;complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come&#10;to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient&#10;and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house&#10;while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the&#10;most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and&#10;they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued&#10;absence.&#10;&#10;Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after&#10;day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the&#10;report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to&#10;Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.&#10;Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous&#10;falsehood.&#10;&#10;Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that&#10;his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as&#10;she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s happiness, and so&#10;dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its&#10;frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters&#10;and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss&#10;Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for&#10;the strength of his attachment.&#10;&#10;As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more&#10;painful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of&#10;concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject&#10;was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,&#10;an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her&#10;impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he&#10;did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed&#10;all Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable&#10;tranquillity.&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his&#10;reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his&#10;first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;&#10;and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them&#10;from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by&#10;him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time&#10;to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of&#10;anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,&#10;and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight&#10;of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she&#10;regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see&#10;them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and&#10;whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that&#10;they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself&#10;and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She&#10;complained bitterly of all this to her husband.&#10;&#10;“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte&#10;Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to&#10;make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!”&#10;&#10;“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for&#10;better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”&#10;&#10;This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of&#10;making any answer, she went on as before.&#10;&#10;“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was&#10;not for the entail, I should not mind it.”&#10;&#10;“What should not you mind?”&#10;&#10;“I should not mind anything at all.”&#10;&#10;“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such&#10;insensibility.”&#10;&#10;“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How&#10;anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own&#10;daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!&#10;Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”&#10;&#10;“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 24&#10;&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first&#10;sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for&#10;the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had&#10;time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left&#10;the country.&#10;&#10;Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest&#10;of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the&#10;writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied&#10;the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline&#10;boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict&#10;the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former&#10;letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an&#10;inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of&#10;the latter with regard to new furniture.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,&#10;heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern&#10;for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s&#10;assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no&#10;credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she&#10;had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she&#10;could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness&#10;of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave&#10;of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness&#10;to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,&#10;been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in&#10;whatever manner he thought best, but her sister’s was involved in it, as&#10;she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,&#10;on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She&#10;could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really&#10;died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether&#10;he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his&#10;observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be&#10;materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained&#10;the same, her peace equally wounded.&#10;&#10;A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to&#10;Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a&#10;longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could&#10;not help saying:&#10;&#10;“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no&#10;idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But&#10;I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall&#10;all be as we were before.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said&#10;nothing.&#10;&#10;“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have&#10;no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my&#10;acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,&#10;and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A&#10;little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.”&#10;&#10;With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,&#10;that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it&#10;has done no harm to anyone but myself.”&#10;&#10;“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness&#10;and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say&#10;to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you&#10;deserve.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back&#10;the praise on her sister’s warm affection.&#10;&#10;“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the&#10;world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want&#10;to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not&#10;be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your&#10;privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people&#10;whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see&#10;of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms&#10;my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the&#10;little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or&#10;sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the&#10;other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is&#10;unaccountable!”&#10;&#10;“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will&#10;ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference&#10;of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and&#10;Charlotte’s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a&#10;large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be&#10;ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like&#10;regard and esteem for our cousin.”&#10;&#10;“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else&#10;could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that&#10;Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her&#10;understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a&#10;conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as&#10;I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him&#10;cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though&#10;it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,&#10;change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade&#10;yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of&#10;danger security for happiness.”&#10;&#10;“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied&#10;Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy&#10;together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You&#10;mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat&#10;you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and&#10;saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy&#10;ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man&#10;to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but&#10;our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than&#10;it does.”&#10;&#10;“And men take care that they should.”&#10;&#10;“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea&#10;of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”&#10;&#10;“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”&#10; said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others&#10;unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,&#10;want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,&#10;will do the business.”&#10;&#10;“And do you impute it to either of those?”&#10;&#10;“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what&#10;I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”&#10;&#10;“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”&#10;&#10;“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can&#10;only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can&#10;secure it.”&#10;&#10;“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his&#10;happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they&#10;may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great&#10;connections, and pride.”&#10;&#10;“Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;&#10;“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have&#10;known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love&#10;her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely&#10;they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think&#10;herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very&#10;objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try&#10;to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an&#10;affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most&#10;unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been&#10;mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what&#10;I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in&#10;the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s&#10;name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no&#10;more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account&#10;for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with&#10;less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she&#10;did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the&#10;effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her&#10;no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at&#10;the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best&#10;comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day,&#10;“your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to&#10;being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.&#10;It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction&#10;among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to&#10;be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in&#10;Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham&#10;be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”&#10;&#10;“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not&#10;all expect Jane’s good fortune.”&#10;&#10;“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of&#10;that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make&#10;the most of it.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom&#10;which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn&#10;family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now&#10;added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already&#10;heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,&#10;was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was&#10;pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they&#10;had known anything of the matter.&#10;&#10;Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be&#10;any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society&#10;of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for&#10;allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else&#10;Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 25&#10;&#10;&#10;After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,&#10;Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of&#10;Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his&#10;side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason&#10;to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would&#10;be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his&#10;relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair&#10;cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another&#10;letter of thanks.&#10;&#10;On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving&#10;her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas&#10;at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly&#10;superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield&#10;ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived&#10;by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so&#10;well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger&#10;than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant&#10;woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the&#10;two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.&#10;They had frequently been staying with her in town.&#10;&#10;The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to&#10;distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was&#10;done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.&#10;Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They&#10;had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her&#10;girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was&#10;nothing in it.&#10;&#10;“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.&#10;Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think&#10;that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had it not&#10;been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,&#10;and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have&#10;a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just&#10;as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,&#10;sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of&#10;them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted&#10;so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves&#10;before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the&#10;greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of&#10;long sleeves.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,&#10;in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her&#10;sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the&#10;conversation.&#10;&#10;When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It&#10;seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am&#10;sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such&#10;as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl&#10;for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets&#10;her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”&#10;&#10;“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not&#10;do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often&#10;happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of&#10;independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in&#10;love with only a few days before.”&#10;&#10;“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so&#10;doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as&#10;often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s acquaintance,&#10;as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley’s&#10;love?”&#10;&#10;“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite&#10;inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time&#10;they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he&#10;offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I&#10;spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be&#10;finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor&#10;Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get&#10;over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you&#10;would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she&#10;would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be&#10;of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as&#10;anything.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded&#10;of her sister’s ready acquiescence.&#10;&#10;“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to&#10;this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of&#10;town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go&#10;out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,&#10;unless he really comes to see her.”&#10;&#10;“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his&#10;friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such&#10;a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may&#10;perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he&#10;would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its&#10;impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley&#10;never stirs without him.”&#10;&#10;“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane&#10;correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”&#10;&#10;“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”&#10;&#10;But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this&#10;point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being&#10;withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which&#10;convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely&#10;hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that&#10;his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends&#10;successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s&#10;attractions.&#10;&#10;Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the&#10;Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she&#10;hoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother,&#10;she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of&#10;seeing him.&#10;&#10;The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,&#10;the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its&#10;engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment&#10;of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family&#10;dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always&#10;made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and&#10;on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s&#10;warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,&#10;from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference&#10;of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and&#10;she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left&#10;Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such&#10;an attachment.&#10;&#10;To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,&#10;unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,&#10;before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very&#10;part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many&#10;acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since&#10;the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher&#10;intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of&#10;procuring.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by&#10;character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject&#10;of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute&#10;description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of&#10;praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both&#10;him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s&#10;treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman’s&#10;reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and&#10;was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam&#10;Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 26&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given&#10;on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after&#10;honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:&#10;&#10;“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because&#10;you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking&#10;openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve&#10;yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want&#10;of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against&#10;_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he&#10;ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you&#10;must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all&#10;expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and&#10;good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”&#10;&#10;“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”&#10;&#10;“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of&#10;myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I&#10;can prevent it.”&#10;&#10;“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”&#10;&#10;“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with&#10;Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,&#10;the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to&#10;me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence&#10;of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does&#10;me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My&#10;father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I&#10;should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but&#10;since we see every day that where there is affection, young people&#10;are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into&#10;engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many&#10;of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it&#10;would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not&#10;to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first&#10;object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,&#10;I will do my best.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very&#10;often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”&#10;&#10;“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very&#10;true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine&#10;that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been&#10;so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the&#10;necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my&#10;honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope&#10;you are satisfied.”&#10;&#10;Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for&#10;the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice&#10;being given on such a point, without being resented.&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted&#10;by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,&#10;his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was&#10;now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think&#10;it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that&#10;she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day,&#10;and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she&#10;rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and&#10;reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her&#10;out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:&#10;&#10;“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”&#10;&#10;“_That_ you certainly shall.”&#10;&#10;“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”&#10;&#10;“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”&#10;&#10;“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to&#10;come to Hunsford.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the&#10;visit.&#10;&#10;“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I&#10;hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as&#10;welcome as either of them.”&#10;&#10;The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from&#10;the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on&#10;the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their&#10;correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that&#10;it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never&#10;address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,&#10;and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the&#10;sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters&#10;were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be&#10;curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would&#10;like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to&#10;be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte&#10;expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She&#10;wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing&#10;which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and&#10;roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most&#10;friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and&#10;Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait&#10;for her own visit there to know the rest.&#10;&#10;Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their&#10;safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it&#10;would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.&#10;&#10;Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience&#10;generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or&#10;hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that&#10;her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been&#10;lost.&#10;&#10;“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the&#10;town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”&#10;&#10;She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.&#10;“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very&#10;glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming&#10;to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached&#10;her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much&#10;engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that&#10;Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was&#10;not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall&#10;see them soon here.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that&#10;accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.&#10;&#10;Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to&#10;persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be&#10;blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning&#10;for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the&#10;visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,&#10;the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no&#10;longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will&#10;prove what she felt.&#10;&#10;“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her&#10;better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been&#10;entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my dear sister,&#10;though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I&#10;still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was&#10;as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for&#10;wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to&#10;happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not&#10;return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I&#10;receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that&#10;she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not&#10;calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was&#10;in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was&#10;perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,&#10;though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out&#10;as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on&#10;her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting&#10;wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the&#10;cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know&#10;this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily&#10;account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to&#10;his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and&#10;amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,&#10;because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.&#10;He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said&#10;herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she&#10;wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I&#10;cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should&#10;be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity&#10;in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,&#10;and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the&#10;invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very&#10;soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield&#10;again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better&#10;not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts&#10;from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and&#10;Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.”&#10;&#10;This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she&#10;considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.&#10;All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not&#10;even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on&#10;every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible&#10;advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.&#10;Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly&#10;regret what he had thrown away.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise&#10;concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth&#10;had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to&#10;herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,&#10;he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to&#10;see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.&#10;Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied&#10;with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune&#10;permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most&#10;remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself&#10;agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than&#10;in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.&#10;Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to&#10;suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was&#10;ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very&#10;sincerely wish him happy.&#10;&#10;All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the&#10;circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that&#10;I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure&#10;and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and&#10;wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial&#10;towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find&#10;out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to&#10;think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My&#10;watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more&#10;interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love&#10;with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.&#10;Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take&#10;his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the&#10;ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that&#10;handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 27&#10;&#10;&#10;With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise&#10;diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and&#10;sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take&#10;Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of&#10;going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan&#10;and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure&#10;as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing&#10;Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There&#10;was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such&#10;uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change&#10;was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her&#10;a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have&#10;been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,&#10;and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was&#10;to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement&#10;of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became&#10;perfect as plan could be.&#10;&#10;The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,&#10;and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he&#10;told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.&#10;&#10;The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on&#10;his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that&#10;Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the&#10;first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner&#10;of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of&#10;what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their&#10;opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there&#10;was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to&#10;him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,&#10;whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable&#10;and pleasing.&#10;&#10;Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her&#10;think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a&#10;good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say&#10;that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much&#10;delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but&#10;she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of&#10;the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were&#10;worn out, like his information.&#10;&#10;It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early&#10;as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s&#10;door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when&#10;they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,&#10;looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and&#10;lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,&#10;whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to&#10;wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen&#10;her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and&#10;kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and&#10;shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her&#10;sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to&#10;her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her&#10;spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,&#10;to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the&#10;particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and&#10;repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and&#10;herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the&#10;acquaintance.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and&#10;complimented her on bearing it so well.&#10;&#10;“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I&#10;should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”&#10;&#10;“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,&#10;between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,&#10;and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,&#10;because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get&#10;a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is&#10;mercenary.”&#10;&#10;“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know&#10;what to think.”&#10;&#10;“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”&#10;&#10;“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death&#10;made her mistress of this fortune.”&#10;&#10;“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_&#10;affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for&#10;making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally&#10;poor?”&#10;&#10;“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her&#10;so soon after this event.”&#10;&#10;“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant&#10;decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,&#10;why should _we_?”&#10;&#10;“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being&#10;deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”&#10;&#10;“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be&#10;mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”&#10;&#10;“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,&#10;to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in&#10;Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not&#10;much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow&#10;where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has&#10;neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones&#10;worth knowing, after all.”&#10;&#10;“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”&#10;&#10;Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the&#10;unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in&#10;a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.&#10;&#10;“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,&#10;“but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”&#10;&#10;No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her&#10;acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear,&#10;dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You&#10;give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What&#10;are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport&#10;we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other&#10;travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We&#10;_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.&#10;Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our&#10;imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,&#10;will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_&#10;first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of&#10;travellers.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 28&#10;&#10;&#10;Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to&#10;Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had&#10;seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,&#10;and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.&#10;&#10;When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in&#10;search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.&#10;The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth&#10;smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.&#10;&#10;At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the&#10;road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,&#10;everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte&#10;appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which&#10;led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of&#10;the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing&#10;at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the&#10;liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with&#10;coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw&#10;instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage;&#10;his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some&#10;minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her&#10;family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the&#10;neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they&#10;were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious&#10;formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s&#10;offers of refreshment.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help&#10;in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its&#10;aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,&#10;as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But&#10;though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to&#10;gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at&#10;her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.&#10;When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be&#10;ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her&#10;eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but&#10;in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to&#10;admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to&#10;the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had&#10;happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the&#10;garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of&#10;which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most&#10;respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance&#10;with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and&#10;owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way&#10;through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an&#10;interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out&#10;with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the&#10;fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in&#10;the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which&#10;the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the&#10;prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered&#10;the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome&#10;modern building, well situated on rising ground.&#10;&#10;From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;&#10;but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white&#10;frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte&#10;took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,&#10;probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s&#10;help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything&#10;was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which&#10;Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be&#10;forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by&#10;Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often&#10;forgotten.&#10;&#10;She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It&#10;was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining&#10;in, observed:&#10;&#10;“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine&#10;de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will&#10;be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I&#10;doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice&#10;when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she&#10;will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she&#10;honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is&#10;charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed&#10;to walk home. Her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I&#10;_should_ say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”&#10;&#10;“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added&#10;Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”&#10;&#10;“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of&#10;woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”&#10;&#10;The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,&#10;and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,&#10;Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon&#10;Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,&#10;and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it&#10;was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit&#10;would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious&#10;interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with&#10;Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.&#10;&#10;About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready&#10;for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in&#10;confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running&#10;up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened&#10;the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with&#10;agitation, cried out--&#10;&#10;“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for&#10;there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make&#10;haste, and come down this moment.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,&#10;and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in&#10;quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the&#10;garden gate.&#10;&#10;“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs&#10;were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her&#10;daughter.”&#10;&#10;“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not&#10;Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;&#10;the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little&#10;creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”&#10;&#10;“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.&#10;Why does she not come in?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours&#10;when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”&#10;&#10;“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She&#10;looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will&#10;make him a very proper wife.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation&#10;with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was&#10;stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness&#10;before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that&#10;way.&#10;&#10;At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and&#10;the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two&#10;girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which&#10;Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked&#10;to dine at Rosings the next day.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 29&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.&#10;The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering&#10;visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his&#10;wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity&#10;of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady&#10;Catherine’s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.&#10;&#10;“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by&#10;her ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at&#10;Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it&#10;would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who&#10;could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there&#10;(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately&#10;after your arrival!”&#10;&#10;“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,&#10;“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which&#10;my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such&#10;instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”&#10;&#10;Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their&#10;visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what&#10;they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and&#10;so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.&#10;&#10;When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--&#10;&#10;“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady&#10;Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which&#10;becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on&#10;whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion&#10;for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you&#10;for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank&#10;preserved.”&#10;&#10;While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different&#10;doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much&#10;objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of&#10;her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas&#10;who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her&#10;introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done&#10;to his presentation at St. James’s.&#10;&#10;As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a&#10;mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and&#10;Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such&#10;raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but&#10;slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the&#10;house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally&#10;cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.&#10;&#10;When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every&#10;moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.&#10;Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady&#10;Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or&#10;miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought&#10;she could witness without trepidation.&#10;&#10;From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a&#10;rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they&#10;followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady&#10;Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,&#10;with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had&#10;settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should&#10;be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those&#10;apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.&#10;&#10;In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely&#10;awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage&#10;enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;&#10;and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge&#10;of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself&#10;quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her&#10;composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked&#10;features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not&#10;conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her&#10;visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by&#10;silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,&#10;as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to&#10;Elizabeth’s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she&#10;believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.&#10;&#10;When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment&#10;she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the&#10;daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her&#10;being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any&#10;likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her&#10;features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very&#10;little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance&#10;there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening&#10;to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before&#10;her eyes.&#10;&#10;After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to&#10;admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,&#10;and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth&#10;looking at in the summer.&#10;&#10;The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and&#10;all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had&#10;likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her&#10;ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish&#10;nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted&#10;alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir&#10;William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law&#10;said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.&#10;But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and&#10;gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved&#10;a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth&#10;was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated&#10;between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in&#10;listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all&#10;dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little&#10;Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing&#10;she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the&#10;gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.&#10;&#10;When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to&#10;be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any&#10;intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every&#10;subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to&#10;have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic&#10;concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as&#10;to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be&#10;regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the&#10;care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was&#10;beneath this great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an&#10;occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse&#10;with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and&#10;Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew&#10;the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,&#10;pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters&#10;she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of&#10;them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they&#10;had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been&#10;her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of&#10;her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then&#10;observed,&#10;&#10;“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your&#10;sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no&#10;occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought&#10;necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss&#10;Bennet?”&#10;&#10;“A little.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our&#10;instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it&#10;some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”&#10;&#10;“One of them does.”&#10;&#10;“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss&#10;Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do&#10;you draw?”&#10;&#10;“No, not at all.”&#10;&#10;“What, none of you?”&#10;&#10;“Not one.”&#10;&#10;“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother&#10;should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”&#10;&#10;“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”&#10;&#10;“Has your governess left you?”&#10;&#10;“We never had any governess.”&#10;&#10;“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home&#10;without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must&#10;have been quite a slave to your education.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been&#10;the case.&#10;&#10;“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you&#10;must have been neglected.”&#10;&#10;“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as&#10;wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to&#10;read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be&#10;idle, certainly might.”&#10;&#10;“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had&#10;known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage&#10;one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady&#10;and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is&#10;wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that&#10;way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces&#10;of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and&#10;it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,&#10;who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite&#10;delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf’s&#10;calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady&#10;Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your&#10;younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, ma’am, all.”&#10;&#10;“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The&#10;younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters&#10;must be very young?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be&#10;much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon&#10;younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and&#10;amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to&#10;marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth&#10;as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would&#10;not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”&#10;&#10;“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly&#10;for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”&#10;&#10;“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your&#10;ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;&#10;and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever&#10;dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.&#10;&#10;“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not&#10;conceal your age.”&#10;&#10;“I am not one-and-twenty.”&#10;&#10;When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables&#10;were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat&#10;down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the&#10;two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her&#10;party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was&#10;uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson&#10;expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or&#10;having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the&#10;other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes&#10;of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins&#10;was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her&#10;for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.&#10;Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes&#10;and noble names.&#10;&#10;When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,&#10;the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,&#10;gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered&#10;round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were&#10;to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by&#10;the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.&#10;Collins’s side and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon&#10;as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin&#10;to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for&#10;Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her&#10;commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy&#10;Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise&#10;into his own hands.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 30&#10;&#10;&#10;Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long&#10;enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,&#10;and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not&#10;often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his&#10;morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but&#10;when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,&#10;and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her&#10;cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast&#10;and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in&#10;reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,&#10;which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.&#10;Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer&#10;the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a&#10;more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent&#10;reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been&#10;much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and&#10;she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.&#10;&#10;From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and&#10;were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went&#10;along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,&#10;which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened&#10;almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and&#10;had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever&#10;prevailed upon to get out.&#10;&#10;Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and&#10;not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;&#10;and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings&#10;to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many&#10;hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,&#10;and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during&#10;these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,&#10;and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement&#10;of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she&#10;accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding&#10;out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in&#10;commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate&#10;in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her&#10;by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to&#10;be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the&#10;village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold&#10;them into harmony and plenty.&#10;&#10;The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;&#10;and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one&#10;card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart&#10;of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living&#10;in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins’s reach. This,&#10;however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time&#10;comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with&#10;Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had&#10;often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she&#10;frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was&#10;along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was&#10;a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and&#10;where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.&#10;&#10;In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.&#10;Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an&#10;addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be&#10;important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was&#10;expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not&#10;many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would&#10;furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and&#10;she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him&#10;were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently&#10;destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest&#10;satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and&#10;seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by&#10;Miss Lucas and herself.&#10;&#10;His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking&#10;the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,&#10;in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his&#10;bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great&#10;intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his&#10;respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for&#10;Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of&#10;his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when&#10;Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen&#10;them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running&#10;into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:&#10;&#10;“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would&#10;never have come so soon to wait upon me.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,&#10;before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly&#10;afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,&#10;who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and&#10;address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been&#10;used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual&#10;reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her&#10;friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely&#10;curtseyed to him without saying a word.&#10;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the&#10;readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but&#10;his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and&#10;garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.&#10;At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of&#10;Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual&#10;way, and after a moment’s pause, added:&#10;&#10;“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never&#10;happened to see her there?”&#10;&#10;She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see&#10;whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between&#10;the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he&#10;answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The&#10;subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went&#10;away.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 31&#10;&#10;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,&#10;and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures&#10;of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they&#10;received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the&#10;house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,&#10;almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by&#10;such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to&#10;come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little&#10;of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the&#10;Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen&#10;only at church.&#10;&#10;The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined&#10;the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship received&#10;them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so&#10;acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,&#10;almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,&#10;much more than to any other person in the room.&#10;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a&#10;welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had&#10;moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and&#10;talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying&#10;at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so&#10;well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much&#10;spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,&#10;as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned&#10;towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a&#10;while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not&#10;scruple to call out:&#10;&#10;“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking&#10;of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”&#10;&#10;“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid&#10;a reply.&#10;&#10;“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I&#10;must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.&#10;There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment&#10;of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,&#10;I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health&#10;had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed&#10;delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.&#10;&#10;“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady&#10;Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel&#10;if she does not practice a good deal.”&#10;&#10;“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.&#10;She practises very constantly.”&#10;&#10;“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write&#10;to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often&#10;tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without&#10;constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she&#10;will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.&#10;Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told&#10;her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.&#10;Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part&#10;of the house.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made&#10;no answer.&#10;&#10;When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having&#10;promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He&#10;drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then&#10;talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away&#10;from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte&#10;stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s&#10;countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first&#10;convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:&#10;&#10;“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear&#10;me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There&#10;is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the&#10;will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate&#10;me.”&#10;&#10;“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not&#10;really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have&#10;had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find&#10;great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are&#10;not your own.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of&#10;me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky&#10;in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part&#10;of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of&#10;credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all&#10;that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to&#10;say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such&#10;things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”&#10;&#10;“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.&#10;&#10;“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel&#10;Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”&#10;&#10;“You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.&#10;The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,&#10;was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced&#10;only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain&#10;knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a&#10;partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”&#10;&#10;“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly&#10;beyond my own party.”&#10;&#10;“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel&#10;Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an&#10;introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”&#10;&#10;“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still&#10;addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and&#10;education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend&#10;himself to strangers?”&#10;&#10;“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to&#10;him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”&#10;&#10;“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,&#10;“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot&#10;catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their&#10;concerns, as I often see done.”&#10;&#10;“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the&#10;masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same&#10;force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I&#10;have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the&#10;trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as&#10;capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”&#10;&#10;Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your&#10;time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can&#10;think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”&#10;&#10;Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know&#10;what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.&#10;Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said&#10;to Darcy:&#10;&#10;“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and&#10;could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion&#10;of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have&#10;been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his&#10;cousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she&#10;discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss&#10;de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have&#10;been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing&#10;with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received&#10;them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the&#10;gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was&#10;ready to take them all home.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 32&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane&#10;while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,&#10;when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a&#10;visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to&#10;be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her&#10;half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,&#10;when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and&#10;Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.&#10;&#10;He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his&#10;intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were&#10;to be within.&#10;&#10;They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,&#10;seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely&#10;necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence&#10;recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and&#10;feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty&#10;departure, she observed:&#10;&#10;“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!&#10;It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you&#10;all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day&#10;before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”&#10;&#10;“Perfectly so, I thank you.”&#10;&#10;She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short&#10;pause added:&#10;&#10;“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever&#10;returning to Netherfield again?”&#10;&#10;“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend&#10;very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and&#10;is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually&#10;increasing.”&#10;&#10;“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for&#10;the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we&#10;might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did&#10;not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as&#10;for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same&#10;principle.”&#10;&#10;“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as&#10;soon as any eligible purchase offers.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his&#10;friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the&#10;trouble of finding a subject to him.&#10;&#10;He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable&#10;house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.&#10;Collins first came to Hunsford.”&#10;&#10;“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her&#10;kindness on a more grateful object.”&#10;&#10;“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one&#10;of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made&#10;him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though&#10;I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the&#10;wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a&#10;prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.”&#10;&#10;“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a&#10;distance of her own family and friends.”&#10;&#10;“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”&#10;&#10;“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s&#10;journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.”&#10;&#10;“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_&#10;of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins&#10;was settled _near_ her family.”&#10;&#10;“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond&#10;the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”&#10;&#10;As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she&#10;understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and&#10;Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:&#10;&#10;“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her&#10;family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many&#10;varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of&#10;travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the&#10;case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not&#10;such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my&#10;friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_&#10;the present distance.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot&#10;have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have&#10;been always at Longbourn.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of&#10;feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and&#10;glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:&#10;&#10;“Are you pleased with Kent?”&#10;&#10;A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side&#10;calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte&#10;and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised&#10;them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding&#10;on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying&#10;much to anybody, went away.&#10;&#10;“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was&#10;gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never&#10;have called us in this familiar way.”&#10;&#10;But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,&#10;even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after various&#10;conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from&#10;the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable&#10;from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there&#10;was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot&#10;always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the&#10;pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the&#10;two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither&#10;almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes&#10;separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their&#10;aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he&#10;had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended&#10;him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in&#10;being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her&#10;former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw&#10;there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners,&#10;she believed he might have the best informed mind.&#10;&#10;But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult&#10;to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there&#10;ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,&#10;it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice&#10;to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really&#10;animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel&#10;Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was&#10;generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told&#10;her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect&#10;of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself&#10;seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at&#10;Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He&#10;certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that&#10;look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often&#10;doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it&#10;seemed nothing but absence of mind.&#10;&#10;She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his&#10;being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.&#10;Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of&#10;raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her&#10;opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would&#10;vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.&#10;&#10;&#10;In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he&#10;certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,&#10;to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage&#10;in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 33&#10;&#10;&#10;More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,&#10;unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the&#10;mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to&#10;prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that&#10;it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,&#10;therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like&#10;wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was&#10;not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,&#10;but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He&#10;never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking&#10;or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third&#10;rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about&#10;her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her&#10;opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of&#10;Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to&#10;expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying&#10;_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel&#10;Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must&#10;mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed&#10;her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the&#10;pales opposite the Parsonage.&#10;&#10;She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last letter,&#10;and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in&#10;spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw&#10;on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the&#10;letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:&#10;&#10;“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”&#10;&#10;“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally&#10;do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are&#10;you going much farther?”&#10;&#10;“No, I should have turned in a moment.”&#10;&#10;And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage&#10;together.&#10;&#10;“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.&#10;&#10;“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He&#10;arranges the business just as he pleases.”&#10;&#10;“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least&#10;pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems&#10;more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”&#10;&#10;“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.&#10;“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it&#10;than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak&#10;feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and&#10;dependence.”&#10;&#10;“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of&#10;either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and&#10;dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going&#10;wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”&#10;&#10;“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have&#10;experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater&#10;weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where&#10;they like.”&#10;&#10;“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often&#10;do.”&#10;&#10;“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many&#10;in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to&#10;money.”&#10;&#10;“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the&#10;idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what&#10;is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is&#10;very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”&#10;&#10;He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt&#10;a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,&#10;she soon afterwards said:&#10;&#10;“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of&#10;having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a&#10;lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well&#10;for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he&#10;likes with her.”&#10;&#10;“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must&#10;divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”&#10;&#10;“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your&#10;charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a&#10;little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she&#10;may like to have her own way.”&#10;&#10;As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner&#10;in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to&#10;give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other&#10;got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:&#10;&#10;“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare&#10;say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a&#10;very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and&#10;Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”&#10;&#10;“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he&#10;is a great friend of Darcy’s.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.&#10;Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”&#10;&#10;“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in&#10;those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in&#10;our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to&#10;him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that&#10;Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”&#10;&#10;“What is it you mean?”&#10;&#10;“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,&#10;because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it would be an&#10;unpleasant thing.”&#10;&#10;“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”&#10;&#10;“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be&#10;Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself&#10;on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most&#10;imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other&#10;particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing&#10;him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from&#10;knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”&#10;&#10;“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”&#10;&#10;“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the&#10;lady.”&#10;&#10;“And what arts did he use to separate them?”&#10;&#10;“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He&#10;only told me what I have now told you.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with&#10;indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she&#10;was so thoughtful.&#10;&#10;“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your&#10;cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”&#10;&#10;“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”&#10;&#10;“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his&#10;friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to&#10;determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.&#10;But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the&#10;particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed&#10;that there was much affection in the case.”&#10;&#10;“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a&#10;lessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”&#10;&#10;This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture&#10;of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and&#10;therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent&#10;matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,&#10;as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption&#10;of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other&#10;people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There&#10;could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have&#10;such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures&#10;taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had&#10;always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement&#10;of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was&#10;the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had&#10;suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while&#10;every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the&#10;world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.&#10;&#10;“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel&#10;Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably were, her&#10;having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in&#10;business in London.&#10;&#10;“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of&#10;objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding&#10;excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither&#10;could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some&#10;peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and&#10;respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of&#10;her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow&#10;that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose&#10;pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of&#10;importance in his friend’s connections, than from their want of sense;&#10;and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed&#10;by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.&#10;Bingley for his sister.&#10;&#10;The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a&#10;headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to&#10;her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her&#10;cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,&#10;seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much&#10;as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins&#10;could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather&#10;displeased by her staying at home.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 34&#10;&#10;&#10;When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself&#10;as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the&#10;examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her&#10;being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any&#10;revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.&#10;But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that&#10;cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,&#10;proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly&#10;disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth&#10;noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an&#10;attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s&#10;shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her&#10;a keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation&#10;to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the&#10;next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should&#10;herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of&#10;her spirits, by all that affection could do.&#10;&#10;She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that&#10;his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear&#10;that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not&#10;mean to be unhappy about him.&#10;&#10;While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the&#10;door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its&#10;being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in&#10;the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.&#10;But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently&#10;affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the&#10;room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her&#10;health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.&#10;She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and&#10;then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but&#10;said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her&#10;in an agitated manner, and thus began:&#10;&#10;“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be&#10;repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love&#10;you.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,&#10;doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;&#10;and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,&#10;immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides&#10;those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the&#10;subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of&#10;its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always&#10;opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to&#10;the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his&#10;suit.&#10;&#10;In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to&#10;the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did&#10;not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to&#10;receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she&#10;lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to&#10;answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with&#10;representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite&#10;of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with&#10;expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of&#10;his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt&#10;of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but&#10;his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could&#10;only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her&#10;cheeks, and she said:&#10;&#10;“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to&#10;express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however&#10;unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should&#10;be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I&#10;cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly&#10;bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to&#10;anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be&#10;of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented&#10;the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in&#10;overcoming it after this explanation.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed&#10;on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than&#10;surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance&#10;of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the&#10;appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed&#10;himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings&#10;dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:&#10;&#10;“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!&#10;I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at&#10;civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”&#10;&#10;“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire&#10;of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me&#10;against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?&#10;Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have&#10;other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against&#10;you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you&#10;think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has&#10;been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most&#10;beloved sister?”&#10;&#10;As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion&#10;was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she&#10;continued:&#10;&#10;“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can&#10;excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,&#10;you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means&#10;of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the&#10;world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for&#10;disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest&#10;kind.”&#10;&#10;She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening&#10;with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.&#10;He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.&#10;&#10;“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.&#10;&#10;With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying&#10;that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your&#10;sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been&#10;kinder than towards myself.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,&#10;but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.&#10;&#10;“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike&#10;is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was&#10;decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received&#10;many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to&#10;say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?&#10;or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”&#10;&#10;“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,&#10;in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.&#10;&#10;“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an&#10;interest in him?”&#10;&#10;“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes&#10;have been great indeed.”&#10;&#10;“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced&#10;him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have&#10;withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for&#10;him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence&#10;which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!&#10;and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and&#10;ridicule.”&#10;&#10;“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,&#10;“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!&#10;I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this&#10;calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in&#10;his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been&#10;overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the&#10;scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These&#10;bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater&#10;policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of&#10;my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by&#10;reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.&#10;Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and&#10;just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your&#10;connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose&#10;condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to&#10;the utmost to speak with composure when she said:&#10;&#10;“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your&#10;declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern&#10;which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more&#10;gentlemanlike manner.”&#10;&#10;She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:&#10;&#10;“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that&#10;would have tempted me to accept it.”&#10;&#10;Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an&#10;expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:&#10;&#10;“From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of&#10;my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest&#10;belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of&#10;the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of&#10;disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a&#10;dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the&#10;last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”&#10;&#10;“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your&#10;feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.&#10;Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best&#10;wishes for your health and happiness.”&#10;&#10;And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him&#10;the next moment open the front door and quit the house.&#10;&#10;The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how&#10;to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for&#10;half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,&#10;was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of&#10;marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for&#10;so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of&#10;all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying&#10;her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his&#10;own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired&#10;unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable&#10;pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to&#10;Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could&#10;not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.&#10;Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon&#10;overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for&#10;a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the&#10;sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to&#10;encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 35&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations&#10;which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the&#10;surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything&#10;else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after&#10;breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding&#10;directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s&#10;sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,&#10;she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The&#10;park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one&#10;of the gates into the ground.&#10;&#10;After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was&#10;tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and&#10;look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had&#10;made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the&#10;verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,&#10;when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which&#10;edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.&#10;Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now&#10;near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced&#10;her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though&#10;in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the&#10;gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,&#10;which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,&#10;“I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.&#10;Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a&#10;slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.&#10;&#10;With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,&#10;Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,&#10;perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written&#10;quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise&#10;full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated&#10;from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--&#10;&#10;“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension&#10;of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those&#10;offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any&#10;intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes&#10;which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the&#10;effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,&#10;should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written&#10;and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand&#10;your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I&#10;demand it of your justice.&#10;&#10;“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal&#10;magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,&#10;that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley&#10;from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various&#10;claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate&#10;prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and&#10;wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged&#10;favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other&#10;dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect&#10;its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young&#10;persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could&#10;bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last&#10;night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope&#10;to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions&#10;and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which&#10;is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which&#10;may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity&#10;must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.&#10;&#10;“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with&#10;others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young&#10;woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance&#10;at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious&#10;attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I&#10;had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir&#10;William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to&#10;your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.&#10;He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could&#10;be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour&#10;attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss&#10;Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also&#10;watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,&#10;but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced&#10;from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions&#10;with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of&#10;sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been&#10;in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter&#10;probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict&#10;pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not&#10;scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and&#10;air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction&#10;that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be&#10;easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is&#10;certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions&#10;are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe&#10;her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial&#10;conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the&#10;marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have&#10;the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of&#10;connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But&#10;there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still&#10;existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had&#10;myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before&#10;me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your&#10;mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that&#10;total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by&#10;herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your&#10;father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern&#10;for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this&#10;representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to&#10;have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,&#10;is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than&#10;it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say&#10;farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties&#10;was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led&#10;me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy&#10;connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as&#10;you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.&#10;&#10;“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness&#10;had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was&#10;soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in&#10;detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in&#10;London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office&#10;of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I&#10;described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance&#10;might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose&#10;that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been&#10;seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your&#10;sister’s indifference. He had before believed her to return his&#10;affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great&#10;natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his&#10;own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was&#10;no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into&#10;Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the&#10;work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There&#10;is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not&#10;reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the&#10;measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in&#10;town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her&#10;brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without&#10;ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me&#10;enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this&#10;concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it&#10;was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no&#10;other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it&#10;was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to&#10;you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn&#10;them.&#10;&#10;“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured&#10;Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his&#10;connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I&#10;am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more&#10;than one witness of undoubted veracity.&#10;&#10;“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many&#10;years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good&#10;conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to&#10;be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his&#10;kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at&#10;school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his&#10;own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have&#10;been unable to give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only&#10;fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he&#10;had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be&#10;his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is&#10;many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different&#10;manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was&#10;careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape&#10;the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,&#10;and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.&#10;Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree&#10;you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham&#10;has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from&#10;unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.&#10;&#10;“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to&#10;Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly&#10;recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner&#10;that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a&#10;valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There&#10;was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long&#10;survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham&#10;wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,&#10;he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more&#10;immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he&#10;could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying&#10;law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would&#10;be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed&#10;him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to&#10;his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the&#10;business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance&#10;in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to&#10;receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection&#10;between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him&#10;to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly&#10;lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free&#10;from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.&#10;For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the&#10;incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to&#10;me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured&#10;me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He&#10;had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely&#10;resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in&#10;question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was&#10;well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not&#10;have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame&#10;me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every&#10;repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of&#10;his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me&#10;to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every&#10;appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But&#10;last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.&#10;&#10;“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,&#10;and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold&#10;to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your&#10;secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to&#10;the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.&#10;About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed&#10;for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided&#10;over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by&#10;design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him&#10;and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and&#10;by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,&#10;whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to&#10;her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and&#10;to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her&#10;excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed&#10;the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two&#10;before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the&#10;idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as&#10;a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and&#10;how I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented&#10;any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place&#10;immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.&#10;Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which&#10;is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of&#10;revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have&#10;been complete indeed.&#10;&#10;“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have&#10;been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as&#10;false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.&#10;Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he&#10;had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered&#10;at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,&#10;detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in&#10;your inclination.&#10;&#10;“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but&#10;I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to&#10;be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more&#10;particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our&#10;near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of&#10;the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted&#10;with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_&#10;should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by&#10;the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be&#10;the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some&#10;opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the&#10;morning. I will only add, God bless you.&#10;&#10;“FITZWILLIAM DARCY”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 36&#10;&#10;&#10;If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to&#10;contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of&#10;its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly&#10;she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.&#10;Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did&#10;she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;&#10;and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation&#10;to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong&#10;prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what&#10;had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly&#10;left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the&#10;next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of&#10;the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s insensibility she&#10;instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst&#10;objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing&#10;him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied&#10;her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and&#10;insolence.&#10;&#10;But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when&#10;she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,&#10;if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which&#10;bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her&#10;feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.&#10;Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished&#10;to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!&#10;This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had&#10;gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the&#10;last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not&#10;regard it, that she would never look in it again.&#10;&#10;In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on&#10;nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter&#10;was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she&#10;again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and&#10;commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.&#10;The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what&#10;he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though&#10;she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own&#10;words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the&#10;will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living&#10;was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was&#10;impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the&#10;other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did&#10;not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the&#10;particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions&#10;to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three&#10;thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down&#10;the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be&#10;impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with&#10;little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read&#10;on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had&#10;believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to&#10;render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a&#10;turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.&#10;&#10;The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at&#10;Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could&#10;bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his&#10;entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the&#10;persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,&#10;had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life&#10;nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As&#10;to his real character, had information been in her power, she had&#10;never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had&#10;established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried&#10;to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of&#10;integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of&#10;Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those&#10;casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy&#10;had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But&#10;no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before&#10;her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more&#10;substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and&#10;the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After&#10;pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to&#10;read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss&#10;Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel&#10;Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was&#10;referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam&#10;himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his&#10;near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and whose character she had no&#10;reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to&#10;him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and&#10;at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never&#10;have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his&#10;cousin’s corroboration.&#10;&#10;She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation&#10;between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips’s.&#10;Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_&#10;struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and&#10;wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting&#10;himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions&#10;with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear&#10;of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that&#10;_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball&#10;the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield&#10;family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but&#10;herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;&#10;that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s&#10;character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would&#10;always prevent his exposing the son.&#10;&#10;How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!&#10;His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and&#10;hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer&#10;the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.&#10;His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had&#10;either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying&#10;his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most&#10;incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter&#10;and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not&#10;but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago&#10;asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as&#10;were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their&#10;acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much&#10;together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything&#10;that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him&#10;of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was&#10;esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a&#10;brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his&#10;sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his&#10;actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of&#10;everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and&#10;that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man&#10;as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.&#10;&#10;She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham&#10;could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,&#10;absurd.&#10;&#10;“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself&#10;on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have&#10;often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified&#10;my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this&#10;discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could&#10;not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my&#10;folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect&#10;of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted&#10;prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were&#10;concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”&#10;&#10;From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line&#10;which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation&#10;_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely&#10;different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that&#10;credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to&#10;give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her&#10;sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s&#10;opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his&#10;description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent, were&#10;little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air&#10;and manner not often united with great sensibility.&#10;&#10;When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were&#10;mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense&#10;of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly&#10;for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as&#10;having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first&#10;disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind&#10;than on hers.&#10;&#10;The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,&#10;but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been&#10;self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered&#10;that Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest&#10;relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt&#10;by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she&#10;had ever known before.&#10;&#10;After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every&#10;variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,&#10;and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and&#10;so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made&#10;her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish&#10;of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such&#10;reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.&#10;&#10;She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each&#10;called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take&#10;leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least&#10;an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her&#10;till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern&#10;in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no&#10;longer an object; she could think only of her letter.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 37&#10;&#10;&#10;The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having&#10;been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was&#10;able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very&#10;good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the&#10;melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then&#10;hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return&#10;brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,&#10;importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of&#10;having them all to dine with her.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had&#10;she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as&#10;her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her&#10;ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how&#10;would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.&#10;&#10;Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure&#10;you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one&#10;feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly&#10;attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to&#10;me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The&#10;dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy&#10;seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His&#10;attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which&#10;were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of&#10;spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that&#10;she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:&#10;&#10;“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that&#10;you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your&#10;company, I am sure.”&#10;&#10;“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied&#10;Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town&#10;next Saturday.”&#10;&#10;“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected&#10;you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There&#10;can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly&#10;spare you for another fortnight.”&#10;&#10;“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters&#10;are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay&#10;another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as&#10;far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as&#10;Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room&#10;for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I&#10;should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”&#10;&#10;“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our&#10;original plan.”&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant&#10;with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea&#10;of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.&#10;You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in&#10;the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly&#10;guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my&#10;niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her&#10;having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of&#10;Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with&#10;propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those&#10;things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I&#10;am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be&#10;discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”&#10;&#10;“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you&#10;have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?&#10;Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be&#10;attended to.”&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,&#10;and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,&#10;which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so&#10;occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be&#10;reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it&#10;as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary&#10;walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant&#10;recollections.&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She&#10;studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at&#10;times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,&#10;she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly&#10;she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against&#10;herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.&#10;His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she&#10;could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,&#10;or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past&#10;behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in&#10;the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.&#10;They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at&#10;them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his&#10;youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right&#10;herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently&#10;united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine&#10;and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,&#10;what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,&#10;irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always&#10;affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would&#10;scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While&#10;there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while&#10;Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there&#10;forever.&#10;&#10;Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s&#10;explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,&#10;heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved&#10;to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any&#10;could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How&#10;grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every&#10;respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had&#10;been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!&#10;&#10;When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s&#10;character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had&#10;seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it&#10;almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.&#10;&#10;Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of&#10;her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent&#10;there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of&#10;their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,&#10;and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right&#10;way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the&#10;work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.&#10;&#10;When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them&#10;a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;&#10;and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her&#10;hand to both.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 38&#10;&#10;&#10;On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few&#10;minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of&#10;paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.&#10;&#10;“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet&#10;expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very&#10;certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for&#10;it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We&#10;know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain&#10;manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we&#10;see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like&#10;yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,&#10;and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending&#10;your time unpleasantly.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She&#10;had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with&#10;Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_&#10;feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling&#10;solemnity replied:&#10;&#10;“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not&#10;disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately&#10;having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,&#10;from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the&#10;humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford&#10;visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to&#10;Lady Catherine’s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage&#10;and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You&#10;see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge&#10;that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should&#10;not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are&#10;sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”&#10;&#10;Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was&#10;obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility&#10;and truth in a few short sentences.&#10;&#10;“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into&#10;Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will&#10;be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you&#10;have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear&#10;that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be&#10;as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,&#10;that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in&#10;marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of&#10;thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of&#10;character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each&#10;other.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was&#10;the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed&#10;and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to&#10;have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.&#10;Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she&#10;had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that&#10;her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her&#10;home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their&#10;dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.&#10;&#10;At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels&#10;placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate&#10;parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by&#10;Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her&#10;with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks&#10;for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his&#10;compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her&#10;in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,&#10;when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had&#10;hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.&#10;&#10;“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects&#10;delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you&#10;while you have been here.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and&#10;the carriage drove off.&#10;&#10;“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems&#10;but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have&#10;happened!”&#10;&#10;“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.&#10;&#10;“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!&#10;How much I shall have to tell!”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”&#10;&#10;Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and&#10;within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s&#10;house, where they were to remain a few days.&#10;&#10;Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her&#10;spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her&#10;aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at&#10;Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.&#10;&#10;It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for&#10;Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know&#10;that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish&#10;Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own&#10;vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation&#10;to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision&#10;in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;&#10;and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried&#10;into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister&#10;further.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 39&#10;&#10;&#10;It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out&#10;together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;&#10;and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage&#10;was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s&#10;punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.&#10;These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed&#10;in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and&#10;dressing a salad and cucumber.&#10;&#10;After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set&#10;out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,&#10;“Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”&#10;&#10;“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the&#10;money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing&#10;her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think&#10;it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall&#10;pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any&#10;better.”&#10;&#10;And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect&#10;unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and&#10;when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I&#10;think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what&#10;one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they&#10;are going in a fortnight.”&#10;&#10;“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.&#10;&#10;“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to&#10;take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;&#10;and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to&#10;go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall&#10;have!”&#10;&#10;“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,&#10;and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole&#10;campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor&#10;regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”&#10;&#10;“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at&#10;table. “What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about&#10;a certain person we all like!”&#10;&#10;Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need&#10;not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:&#10;&#10;“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the&#10;waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse&#10;things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad&#10;he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for&#10;my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?&#10;There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She&#10;is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”&#10;&#10;“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection&#10;imprudent as to fortune.”&#10;&#10;“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”&#10;&#10;“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.&#10;&#10;“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared&#10;three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled&#10;thing?”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such&#10;coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_&#10;was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!&#10;&#10;As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was&#10;ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their&#10;boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and&#10;Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.&#10;&#10;“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my&#10;bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now&#10;let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way&#10;home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all&#10;since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any&#10;flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband&#10;before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.&#10;She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not&#10;being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to&#10;get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.&#10;Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!&#10;how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would&#10;chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece&#10;of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend&#10;the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the&#10;evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so&#10;she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen&#10;was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We&#10;dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for a&#10;lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.&#10;Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow&#10;one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,&#10;and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they&#10;did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.&#10;Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect&#10;something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”&#10;&#10;With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did&#10;Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her&#10;companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she&#10;could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.&#10;&#10;Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane&#10;in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet&#10;say voluntarily to Elizabeth:&#10;&#10;“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”&#10;&#10;Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases&#10;came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that&#10;occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and&#10;poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one&#10;hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat&#10;some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger&#10;Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s,&#10;was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who&#10;would hear her.&#10;&#10;“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!&#10;As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there&#10;was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty&#10;had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved&#10;very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold&#10;luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated&#10;you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never&#10;should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then&#10;we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that&#10;anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”&#10;&#10;To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,&#10;to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the&#10;generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for&#10;_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.”&#10;&#10;But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to&#10;anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.&#10;&#10;In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk&#10;to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily&#10;opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could&#10;not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.&#10;There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.&#10;Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The&#10;comfort to _her_ of the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond&#10;expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped&#10;there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.&#10;&#10;She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton&#10;scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under&#10;frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her&#10;father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were&#10;at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often&#10;disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 40&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could&#10;no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every&#10;particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be&#10;surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene&#10;between Mr. Darcy and herself.&#10;&#10;Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly&#10;partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly&#10;natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was&#10;sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so&#10;little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the&#10;unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.&#10;&#10;“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly&#10;ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his&#10;disappointment!”&#10;&#10;“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has&#10;other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.&#10;You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”&#10;&#10;“Blame you! Oh, no.”&#10;&#10;“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”&#10;&#10;“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”&#10;&#10;“But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next&#10;day.”&#10;&#10;She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far&#10;as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!&#10;who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that&#10;so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here&#10;collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though&#10;grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.&#10;Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and&#10;seek to clear the one without involving the other.&#10;&#10;“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both&#10;of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied&#10;with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just&#10;enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting&#10;about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy’s;&#10;but you shall do as you choose.”&#10;&#10;It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.&#10;&#10;“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so&#10;very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only&#10;consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the&#10;knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing&#10;of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it&#10;so.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so&#10;full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am&#10;growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion&#10;makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will&#10;be as light as a feather.”&#10;&#10;“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his&#10;countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”&#10;&#10;“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those&#10;two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the&#10;appearance of it.”&#10;&#10;“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you&#10;used to do.”&#10;&#10;“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike&#10;to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an&#10;opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually&#10;abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing&#10;at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”&#10;&#10;“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat&#10;the matter as you do now.”&#10;&#10;“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And&#10;with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say&#10;that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I&#10;had! Oh! how I wanted you!”&#10;&#10;“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions&#10;in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly&#10;undeserved.”&#10;&#10;“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most&#10;natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There&#10;is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I&#10;ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand&#10;Wickham’s character.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no&#10;occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”&#10;&#10;“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me&#10;to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular&#10;relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to&#10;myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his&#10;conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy&#10;is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in&#10;Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal&#10;to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to&#10;anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,&#10;and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At&#10;present I will say nothing about it.”&#10;&#10;“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for&#10;ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to&#10;re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”&#10;&#10;The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had&#10;got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,&#10;and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish&#10;to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,&#10;of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other&#10;half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she&#10;had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one&#10;could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect&#10;understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off&#10;this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very&#10;improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to&#10;tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The&#10;liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”&#10;&#10;She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real&#10;state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a&#10;very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself&#10;in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,&#10;and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first&#10;attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,&#10;and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her&#10;attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the&#10;indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own&#10;health and their tranquillity.&#10;&#10;“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of&#10;this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak&#10;of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But&#10;I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is&#10;a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there’s the least&#10;chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of&#10;his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of&#10;everybody, too, who is likely to know.”&#10;&#10;“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”&#10;&#10;“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I&#10;shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I&#10;would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will&#10;die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”&#10;&#10;But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,&#10;she made no answer.&#10;&#10;“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the&#10;Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope&#10;it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an&#10;excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her&#10;mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_&#10;housekeeping, I dare say.”&#10;&#10;“No, nothing at all.”&#10;&#10;“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will&#10;take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed&#10;for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often&#10;talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as&#10;quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”&#10;&#10;“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”&#10;&#10;“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they&#10;often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an&#10;estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be&#10;ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 41&#10;&#10;&#10;The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was&#10;the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies&#10;in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost&#10;universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,&#10;and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very&#10;frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and&#10;Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such&#10;hard-heartedness in any of the family.&#10;&#10;“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they&#10;often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,&#10;Lizzy?”&#10;&#10;Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what&#10;she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years&#10;ago.&#10;&#10;“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel&#10;Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”&#10;&#10;“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.&#10;&#10;“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so&#10;disagreeable.”&#10;&#10;“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”&#10;&#10;“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”&#10; added Kitty.&#10;&#10;Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through&#10;Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense&#10;of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s&#10;objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his&#10;interference in the views of his friend.&#10;&#10;But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she&#10;received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of&#10;the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a&#10;very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour&#10;and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of&#10;their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.&#10;&#10;The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,&#10;the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely&#10;to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia&#10;flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s&#10;congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;&#10;whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate&#10;in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.&#10;&#10;“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”&#10; said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much&#10;right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”&#10;&#10;In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make&#10;her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from&#10;exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she&#10;considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense&#10;for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it&#10;known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her&#10;go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general&#10;behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of&#10;such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more&#10;imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must&#10;be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:&#10;&#10;“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public&#10;place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so&#10;little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present&#10;circumstances.”&#10;&#10;“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to&#10;us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and&#10;imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you&#10;would judge differently in the affair.”&#10;&#10;“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away&#10;some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such&#10;squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity&#10;are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who&#10;have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”&#10;&#10;“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not&#10;of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our&#10;importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the&#10;wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark&#10;Lydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear&#10;father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and&#10;of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of&#10;her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character&#10;will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt&#10;that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the&#10;worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond&#10;youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness&#10;of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal&#10;contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger&#10;Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,&#10;ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you&#10;suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever&#10;they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the&#10;disgrace?”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and&#10;affectionately taking her hand said in reply:&#10;&#10;“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known&#10;you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less&#10;advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly&#10;sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to&#10;Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will&#10;keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an&#10;object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance&#10;even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find&#10;women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being&#10;there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow&#10;many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest&#10;of her life.”&#10;&#10;With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion&#10;continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not&#10;in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on&#10;them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret&#10;over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her&#10;disposition.&#10;&#10;Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her&#10;father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their&#10;united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised&#10;every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye&#10;of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.&#10;She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them&#10;at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents&#10;stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young&#10;and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she&#10;saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six&#10;officers at once.&#10;&#10;Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such&#10;realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have&#10;been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.&#10;Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy&#10;conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there himself.&#10;&#10;But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures&#10;continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving&#10;home.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been&#10;frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty&#10;well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even&#10;learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted&#10;her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present&#10;behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,&#10;for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which&#10;had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after&#10;what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in&#10;finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous&#10;gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the&#10;reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever&#10;cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,&#10;and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.&#10;&#10;On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he dined,&#10;with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth&#10;disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some&#10;inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she&#10;mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three&#10;weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.&#10;&#10;He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s&#10;recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen&#10;him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,&#10;asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.&#10;With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:&#10;&#10;“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”&#10;&#10;“Nearly three weeks.”&#10;&#10;“And you saw him frequently?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, almost every day.”&#10;&#10;“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”&#10;&#10;“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And&#10;pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is&#10;it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility&#10;to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower&#10;and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much&#10;what he ever was.”&#10;&#10;While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to&#10;rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a&#10;something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive&#10;and anxious attention, while she added:&#10;&#10;“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that&#10;his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from&#10;knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”&#10;&#10;Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated&#10;look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his&#10;embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of&#10;accents:&#10;&#10;“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily&#10;comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume&#10;even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,&#10;may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only&#10;deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only&#10;fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been&#10;alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good&#10;opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always&#10;operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be&#10;imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I&#10;am certain he has very much at heart.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a&#10;slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on&#10;the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge&#10;him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his&#10;side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish&#10;Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a&#10;mutual desire of never meeting again.&#10;&#10;When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,&#10;from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation&#10;between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the&#10;only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.&#10;Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,&#10;and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the&#10;opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which&#10;there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in&#10;the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more&#10;gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 42&#10;&#10;&#10;Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could&#10;not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic&#10;comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance&#10;of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a&#10;woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in&#10;their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,&#10;esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views&#10;of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of&#10;a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own&#10;imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often&#10;console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of&#10;the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal&#10;enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as&#10;her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not&#10;the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his&#10;wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true&#10;philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her&#10;father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but&#10;respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of&#10;herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to&#10;banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation&#10;and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own&#10;children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so&#10;strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so&#10;unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising&#10;from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,&#10;might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even&#10;if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.&#10;&#10;When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found little&#10;other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties&#10;abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and&#10;sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around&#10;them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty&#10;might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers&#10;of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition&#10;greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all&#10;her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a&#10;watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what&#10;has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been&#10;looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the&#10;satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to&#10;name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have&#10;some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by&#10;again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the&#10;present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes&#10;was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation&#10;for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother&#10;and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the&#10;scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.&#10;&#10;“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.&#10;Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.&#10;But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my&#10;sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of&#10;pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can&#10;never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by&#10;the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”&#10;&#10;When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely&#10;to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and&#10;always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that&#10;they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers&#10;had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as&#10;made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which&#10;she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a&#10;violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to&#10;the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still&#10;less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were&#10;much too full of lines under the words to be made public.&#10;&#10;After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good&#10;humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore&#10;a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came&#10;back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet&#10;was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of&#10;June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without&#10;tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by&#10;the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to&#10;mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious&#10;arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in&#10;Meryton.&#10;&#10;The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast&#10;approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter&#10;arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and&#10;curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from&#10;setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again&#10;within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so&#10;far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with&#10;the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up&#10;the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the&#10;present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that&#10;county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three&#10;weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The&#10;town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where&#10;they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of&#10;her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,&#10;Dovedale, or the Peak.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing&#10;the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it&#10;was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;&#10;and all was soon right again.&#10;&#10;With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was&#10;impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its&#10;owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,&#10;and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”&#10;&#10;The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away&#10;before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.&#10;and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at&#10;Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two&#10;younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their&#10;cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and&#10;sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every&#10;way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.&#10;&#10;The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the&#10;next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.&#10;One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;&#10;a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear&#10;inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection&#10;and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were&#10;disappointments abroad.&#10;&#10;It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,&#10;nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither&#10;lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are&#10;sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present&#10;concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s&#10;former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance&#10;still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the&#10;principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,&#10;Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not&#10;in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In&#10;talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed&#10;an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his&#10;willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.&#10;&#10;“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard&#10;so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your&#10;acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you&#10;know.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at&#10;Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She&#10;must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so&#10;many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house&#10;richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but&#10;the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the&#10;country.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The&#10;possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly&#10;occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and&#10;thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such&#10;a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved&#10;that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the&#10;absence of the family were unfavourably answered.&#10;&#10;Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid&#10;whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its&#10;proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for&#10;the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her&#10;alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of&#10;curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the&#10;next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and&#10;with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike&#10;to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 43&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of&#10;Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned&#10;in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.&#10;&#10;The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They&#10;entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through&#10;a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired&#10;every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for&#10;half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable&#10;eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by&#10;Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which&#10;the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone&#10;building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of&#10;high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was&#10;swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks&#10;were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She&#10;had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural&#10;beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were&#10;all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that&#10;to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!&#10;&#10;They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,&#10;while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of&#10;meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been&#10;mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the&#10;hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to&#10;wonder at her being where she was.&#10;&#10;The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less&#10;fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They&#10;followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned&#10;room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went&#10;to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which&#10;they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,&#10;was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and&#10;she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its&#10;banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,&#10;with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking&#10;different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be&#10;seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to&#10;the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of&#10;his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of&#10;splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.&#10;&#10;“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With&#10;these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of&#10;viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and&#10;welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting&#10;herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to&#10;me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”&#10;&#10;This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like&#10;regret.&#10;&#10;She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really&#10;absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question&#10;was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.&#10;Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with&#10;a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own&#10;journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!&#10;&#10;Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the&#10;likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,&#10;over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.&#10;The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young&#10;gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought&#10;up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;&#10;“but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not&#10;return it.&#10;&#10;“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,&#10;“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the&#10;other--about eight years ago.”&#10;&#10;“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,&#10;looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell&#10;us whether it is like or not.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this&#10;intimation of her knowing her master.&#10;&#10;“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”&#10;&#10;“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, very handsome.”&#10;&#10;“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you&#10;will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late&#10;master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to&#10;be then. He was very fond of them.”&#10;&#10;This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn&#10;when she was only eight years old.&#10;&#10;“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.&#10;&#10;“Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so&#10;accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is&#10;a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she&#10;comes here to-morrow with him.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her&#10;communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either&#10;by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her&#10;master and his sister.&#10;&#10;“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”&#10;&#10;“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his&#10;time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”&#10;&#10;“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”&#10;&#10;“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is&#10;good enough for him.”&#10;&#10;Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is&#10;very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”&#10;&#10;“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”&#10; replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she&#10;listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have&#10;never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever&#10;since he was four years old.”&#10;&#10;This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her&#10;ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.&#10;Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was&#10;grateful to her uncle for saying:&#10;&#10;“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in&#10;having such a master.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could&#10;not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are&#10;good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and&#10;he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the&#10;world.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.&#10;&#10;“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.&#10;&#10;“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just&#10;as affable to the poor.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.&#10;Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects&#10;of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the&#10;furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family&#10;prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her&#10;master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his&#10;many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.&#10;&#10;“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever&#10;lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but&#10;themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give&#10;him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw&#10;anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away&#10;like other young men.”&#10;&#10;“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not&#10;quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps we might be deceived.”&#10;&#10;“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”&#10;&#10;On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty&#10;sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than&#10;the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to&#10;give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when&#10;last at Pemberley.&#10;&#10;“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards&#10;one of the windows.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter&#10;the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever&#10;can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There&#10;is nothing he would not do for her.”&#10;&#10;The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were&#10;all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;&#10;but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already&#10;visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss&#10;Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and&#10;also more intelligible.&#10;&#10;In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have&#10;little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of&#10;the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested&#10;her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a&#10;smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he&#10;looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest&#10;contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.&#10;Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s&#10;lifetime.&#10;&#10;There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle&#10;sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of&#10;their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds&#10;was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise&#10;of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she&#10;considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship!--how&#10;much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of&#10;good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought&#10;forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she&#10;stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his&#10;eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of&#10;gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and&#10;softened its impropriety of expression.&#10;&#10;When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,&#10;they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were&#10;consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.&#10;&#10;As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back&#10;to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former&#10;was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself&#10;suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.&#10;&#10;They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his&#10;appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes&#10;instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest&#10;blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from&#10;surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,&#10;and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least&#10;of perfect civility.&#10;&#10;She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,&#10;received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be&#10;overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture&#10;they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two&#10;that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on&#10;beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little&#10;aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,&#10;scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer&#10;she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the&#10;alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that&#10;he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the&#10;impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few&#10;minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in&#10;her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent&#10;had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as&#10;to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in&#10;Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the&#10;distraction of his thoughts.&#10;&#10;At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few&#10;moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took&#10;leave.&#10;&#10;The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but&#10;Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,&#10;followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her&#10;coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the&#10;world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light&#10;might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely&#10;thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he&#10;thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes&#10;sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;&#10;for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted&#10;from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over&#10;the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly&#10;altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was&#10;amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!&#10;Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never&#10;had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What&#10;a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put&#10;his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account&#10;for it.&#10;&#10;They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and&#10;every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer&#10;reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time&#10;before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered&#10;mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and&#10;seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she&#10;distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that&#10;one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then&#10;was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in&#10;what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,&#10;she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he&#10;felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was&#10;not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in&#10;seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with&#10;composure.&#10;&#10;At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind&#10;aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.&#10;&#10;They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,&#10;ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of&#10;the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the&#10;valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading&#10;many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish&#10;of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.&#10;With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.&#10;It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which&#10;brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,&#10;to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed&#10;it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;&#10;it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the&#10;valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,&#10;and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.&#10;Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the&#10;bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,&#10;who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only&#10;of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,&#10;therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house&#10;on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their&#10;progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the&#10;taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the&#10;occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the&#10;man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this&#10;slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment&#10;was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy&#10;approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here&#10;less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before&#10;they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared&#10;for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with&#10;calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,&#10;she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea&#10;lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the&#10;turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw&#10;that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his&#10;politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;&#10;but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when&#10;some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of&#10;Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,&#10;and she said no more.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked&#10;her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.&#10;This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;&#10;and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the&#10;acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had&#10;revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought&#10;she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of&#10;fashion.”&#10;&#10;The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their&#10;relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore&#10;it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he&#10;could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the&#10;connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and&#10;so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into&#10;conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,&#10;could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had&#10;some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most&#10;attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every&#10;expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,&#10;his taste, or his good manners.&#10;&#10;The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy&#10;invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he&#10;chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time&#10;to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of&#10;the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was&#10;walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.&#10;Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment&#10;must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and&#10;continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can&#10;it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his&#10;manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a&#10;change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”&#10;&#10;After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two&#10;gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to&#10;the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious&#10;water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated&#10;in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found&#10;Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred&#10;her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on&#10;together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him&#10;to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the&#10;place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been&#10;very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that&#10;you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we&#10;left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected&#10;in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that&#10;business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours&#10;before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They&#10;will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some&#10;who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly&#10;driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been the last&#10;mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_&#10;mind was not very differently engaged.&#10;&#10;“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a&#10;pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow&#10;me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance&#10;during your stay at Lambton?”&#10;&#10;The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great&#10;for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt&#10;that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her&#10;must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was&#10;satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made&#10;him think really ill of her.&#10;&#10;They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth&#10;was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and&#10;pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of&#10;the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had&#10;reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a&#10;mile behind.&#10;&#10;He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not&#10;tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might&#10;have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but&#10;there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected&#10;that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale&#10;with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her&#10;patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was&#10;over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go&#10;into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and&#10;they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the&#10;ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him&#10;walking slowly towards the house.&#10;&#10;The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them&#10;pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.&#10;“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.&#10;&#10;“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her&#10;aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now&#10;say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I&#10;have seen nothing of it.”&#10;&#10;“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more&#10;than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such&#10;attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”&#10;&#10;“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;&#10;or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features&#10;are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so&#10;disagreeable?”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked&#10;him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never&#10;seen him so pleasant as this morning.&#10;&#10;“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied&#10;her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him&#10;at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off&#10;his grounds.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but&#10;said nothing.&#10;&#10;“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really&#10;should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by&#10;anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.&#10;On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he&#10;speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would&#10;not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the&#10;good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!&#10;I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal&#10;master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every&#10;virtue.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of&#10;his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in&#10;as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from&#10;his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different&#10;construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor&#10;Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In&#10;confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary&#10;transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming&#10;her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now&#10;approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to&#10;the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out&#10;to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of&#10;anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk they&#10;had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former&#10;acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a&#10;intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.&#10;&#10;The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth&#10;much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing&#10;but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above&#10;all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 44&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit&#10;her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently&#10;resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.&#10;But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their&#10;arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the&#10;place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn&#10;to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a&#10;carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in&#10;a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing&#10;the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her&#10;surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she&#10;expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment&#10;of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many&#10;of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on&#10;the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that&#10;there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a&#10;quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these&#10;newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of&#10;Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite&#10;amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,&#10;she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much&#10;in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally&#10;suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.&#10;&#10;She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked&#10;up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of&#10;inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.&#10;&#10;Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction&#10;took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new&#10;acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her&#10;being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;&#10;but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was&#10;only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from&#10;her beyond a monosyllable.&#10;&#10;Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though&#10;little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance&#10;womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there&#10;was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly&#10;unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as&#10;acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much&#10;relieved by discerning such different feelings.&#10;&#10;They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley&#10;was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her&#10;satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick&#10;step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All&#10;Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still&#10;felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected&#10;cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He&#10;inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked&#10;and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.&#10;&#10;To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage&#10;than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before&#10;them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just&#10;arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards&#10;each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from&#10;those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew&#10;what it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little&#10;in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was&#10;evident enough.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the&#10;feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and&#10;to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she&#10;feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she&#10;endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley&#10;was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.&#10;&#10;In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!&#10;how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in&#10;a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on&#10;former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion&#10;that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,&#10;though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his&#10;behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look&#10;appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred&#10;between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point&#10;she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred&#10;ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a&#10;recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying&#10;more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed&#10;to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone&#10;which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since&#10;he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,&#10;he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of&#10;November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards&#10;took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether&#10;_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,&#10;nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which&#10;gave them meaning.&#10;&#10;It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;&#10;but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general&#10;complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed&#10;from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that&#10;the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however&#10;temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When&#10;she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion&#10;of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a&#10;disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the&#10;very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last&#10;lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was&#10;so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly&#10;restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company&#10;of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations&#10;at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from&#10;self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance&#10;could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the&#10;acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw&#10;down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and&#10;Rosings.&#10;&#10;Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose&#10;to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing&#10;their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner&#10;at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a&#10;diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,&#10;readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing&#10;how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its&#10;acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,&#10;that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than&#10;any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of&#10;society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for&#10;her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.&#10;&#10;Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth&#10;again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to&#10;make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all&#10;this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on&#10;this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their&#10;visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some&#10;satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been&#10;little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her&#10;uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their&#10;favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.&#10;&#10;But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was&#10;not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was&#10;much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;&#10;it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to&#10;interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.&#10;&#10;Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far&#10;as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could&#10;not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character&#10;from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference&#10;to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known&#10;would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,&#10;however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible&#10;that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four&#10;years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be&#10;hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of&#10;their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had&#10;nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,&#10;it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town&#10;where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he&#10;was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.&#10;&#10;With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held&#10;there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the&#10;son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known&#10;fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind&#10;him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.&#10;&#10;As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than&#10;the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not&#10;long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;&#10;and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She&#10;certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she&#10;had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,&#10;that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his&#10;valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some&#10;time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened&#10;into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in&#10;his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,&#10;which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,&#10;there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.&#10;It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,&#10;but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and&#10;acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations&#10;accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid&#10;her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most&#10;eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display&#10;of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only&#10;were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent&#10;on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much&#10;pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent&#10;love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a&#10;sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be&#10;exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,&#10;she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how&#10;far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would&#10;be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her&#10;fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of&#10;his addresses.&#10;&#10;It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that&#10;such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to see them on the&#10;very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a&#10;late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,&#10;by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that&#10;it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following&#10;morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when&#10;she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.&#10;&#10;Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been&#10;renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting&#10;some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 45&#10;&#10;&#10;Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had&#10;originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her&#10;appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how&#10;much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.&#10;&#10;On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,&#10;whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows&#10;opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody&#10;hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts&#10;which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.&#10;&#10;In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there&#10;with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in&#10;London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with&#10;all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear&#10;of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior&#10;the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,&#10;however, did her justice, and pitied her.&#10;&#10;By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,&#10;on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,&#10;succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a&#10;genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind&#10;of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the&#10;others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from&#10;Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she&#10;wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a&#10;short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,&#10;and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without&#10;calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her&#10;from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an&#10;inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity&#10;of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every&#10;moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she&#10;feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether&#10;she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After&#10;sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss&#10;Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold&#10;inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal&#10;indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.&#10;&#10;The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the&#10;entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the&#10;finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many&#10;a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been&#10;given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole&#10;party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the&#10;beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected&#10;them round the table.&#10;&#10;While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether&#10;she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the&#10;feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but&#10;a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to&#10;regret that he came.&#10;&#10;He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other&#10;gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him&#10;only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to&#10;Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely&#10;resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more&#10;necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she&#10;saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,&#10;and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour&#10;when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive&#10;curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the&#10;smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its&#10;objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions&#10;to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s&#10;entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he&#10;was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded&#10;as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss&#10;Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the&#10;first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:&#10;&#10;“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?&#10;They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”&#10;&#10;In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but Elizabeth&#10;instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the&#10;various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;&#10;but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she&#10;presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While&#10;she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened&#10;complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with&#10;confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what&#10;pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would&#10;have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose&#10;Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed&#10;her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in&#10;Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies&#10;and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected&#10;with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s&#10;meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy&#10;was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections&#10;her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very&#10;wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming&#10;hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without&#10;meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss&#10;Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern&#10;for the welfare of his friend.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and&#10;as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to&#10;Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able&#10;to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely&#10;recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which&#10;had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have&#10;fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.&#10;&#10;Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above&#10;mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss&#10;Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s person,&#10;behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother’s&#10;recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not&#10;err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana&#10;without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When&#10;Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to&#10;him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.&#10;&#10;“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she&#10;cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since&#10;the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing&#10;that we should not have known her again.”&#10;&#10;However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented&#10;himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than&#10;her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the&#10;summer.&#10;&#10;“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could&#10;see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no&#10;brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose&#10;wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are&#10;tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,&#10;which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything&#10;extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do&#10;not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency&#10;without fashion, which is intolerable.”&#10;&#10;Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not&#10;the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always&#10;wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the&#10;success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a&#10;determination of making him speak, she continued:&#10;&#10;“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all&#10;were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect&#10;your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_&#10;a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she&#10;seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at&#10;one time.”&#10;&#10;“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_&#10;was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have&#10;considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”&#10;&#10;He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of&#10;having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their&#10;visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them&#10;both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,&#10;except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked&#10;of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but&#10;himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of&#10;him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s&#10;beginning the subject.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 46&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from&#10;Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been&#10;renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but&#10;on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the&#10;receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that&#10;it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as&#10;Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.&#10;&#10;They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and&#10;her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by&#10;themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been&#10;written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their&#10;little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;&#10;but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident&#10;agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:&#10;&#10;“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a&#10;most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be&#10;assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.&#10;An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,&#10;from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland&#10;with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our&#10;surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am&#10;very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing&#10;to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.&#10;Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step&#10;(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is&#10;disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.&#10;Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How&#10;thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against&#10;him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about&#10;twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at&#10;eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have&#10;passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect&#10;him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of&#10;their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor&#10;mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly&#10;know what I have written.”&#10;&#10;Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing&#10;what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the&#10;other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it&#10;had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.&#10;&#10;“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I&#10;wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my&#10;head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest&#10;Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,&#10;and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham&#10;and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has&#10;taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone&#10;to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the&#10;day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short&#10;letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna&#10;Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.&#10;never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was&#10;repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.&#10;intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,&#10;but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney&#10;coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that&#10;is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.&#10;I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that&#10;side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing&#10;them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but&#10;without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With&#10;the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions&#10;to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved&#10;for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our&#10;distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the&#10;worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make&#10;it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue&#10;their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a&#10;young woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose&#10;her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that&#10;Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his&#10;head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to&#10;be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she&#10;exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And&#10;as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has&#10;anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of&#10;confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you&#10;have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the&#10;first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not&#10;so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I&#10;take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but&#10;circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to&#10;come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,&#10;that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something&#10;more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel&#10;Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure&#10;I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any&#10;measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to&#10;be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my&#10;uncle’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will&#10;immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat&#10;as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing&#10;a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was&#10;opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous&#10;manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,&#10;she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation,&#10;hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find&#10;Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not&#10;an instant to lose.”&#10;&#10;“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than&#10;politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;&#10;but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are&#10;not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how&#10;little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back&#10;the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless&#10;an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and&#10;mistress home instantly.&#10;&#10;On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and&#10;looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,&#10;or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,&#10;“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you&#10;present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”&#10;&#10;“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There&#10;is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by&#10;some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”&#10;&#10;She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could&#10;not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say&#10;something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate&#10;silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,&#10;with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger&#10;sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into&#10;the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.&#10;_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no&#10;connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”&#10;&#10;Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet&#10;more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what&#10;he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I&#10;learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not&#10;have happened. But it is all--all too late now.”&#10;&#10;“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it&#10;certain--absolutely certain?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced&#10;almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to&#10;Scotland.”&#10;&#10;“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”&#10;&#10;“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s&#10;immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But&#10;nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is&#10;such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have&#10;not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”&#10;&#10;Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.&#10;&#10;“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what&#10;I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too&#10;much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”&#10;&#10;Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking&#10;up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air&#10;gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her&#10;power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family&#10;weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither&#10;wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing&#10;consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It&#10;was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own&#10;wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved&#10;him, as now, when all love must be vain.&#10;&#10;But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the&#10;humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed&#10;up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,&#10;Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of&#10;several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by&#10;the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke&#10;compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been&#10;long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my&#10;stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything&#10;could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to&#10;such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may&#10;seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I&#10;fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley&#10;to-day.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that&#10;urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as&#10;long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”&#10;&#10;He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for&#10;her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present&#10;reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only&#10;one serious, parting look, went away.&#10;&#10;As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they&#10;should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as&#10;had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a&#10;retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full&#10;of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those&#10;feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would&#10;formerly have rejoiced in its termination.&#10;&#10;If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s&#10;change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if&#10;otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or&#10;unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on&#10;a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been&#10;exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given&#10;somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,&#10;and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other&#10;less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him&#10;go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must&#10;produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched&#10;business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had she entertained&#10;a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,&#10;could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least&#10;of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first&#10;letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that&#10;Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry&#10;for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared&#10;incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment&#10;as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose&#10;Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention&#10;of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue&#10;nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.&#10;&#10;She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that&#10;Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia&#10;wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one&#10;officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions&#10;raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been&#10;fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and&#10;mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now&#10;feel it!&#10;&#10;She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to&#10;share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a&#10;family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and&#10;requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing&#10;could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost&#10;importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.&#10;and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s&#10;account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them&#10;instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their&#10;summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript&#10;of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a&#10;favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply&#10;afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the&#10;first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every&#10;assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked&#10;him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,&#10;everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to&#10;be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”&#10; cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for&#10;us; was it so?”&#10;&#10;“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.&#10;_That_ is all settled.”&#10;&#10;“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to&#10;prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real&#10;truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”&#10;&#10;But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the&#10;hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure&#10;to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was&#10;impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of&#10;business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to&#10;be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their&#10;sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.&#10;Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing&#10;remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of&#10;the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could&#10;have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 47&#10;&#10;&#10;“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they&#10;drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much&#10;more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the&#10;matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should&#10;form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or&#10;friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I&#10;am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends&#10;would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the&#10;regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is&#10;not adequate to the risk!”&#10;&#10;“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.&#10;&#10;“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s&#10;opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and&#10;interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of&#10;Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe&#10;him capable of it?”&#10;&#10;“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other&#10;neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I&#10;dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been&#10;the case?”&#10;&#10;“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof&#10;that they are not gone to Scotland.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such&#10;a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the&#10;Barnet road.”&#10;&#10;“Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though&#10;for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is&#10;not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it&#10;might strike them that they could be more economically, though less&#10;expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”&#10;&#10;“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their&#10;marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular&#10;friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending&#10;to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He&#10;cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she&#10;beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,&#10;forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what&#10;restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a&#10;dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know&#10;nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your&#10;other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has&#10;no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s&#10;behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever&#10;seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would&#10;do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in&#10;such a matter.”&#10;&#10;“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him&#10;as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”&#10;&#10;“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with&#10;tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such&#10;a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.&#10;Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never&#10;been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,&#10;nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement&#10;and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle&#10;and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.&#10;Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,&#10;flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing&#10;everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give&#10;greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are&#10;naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of&#10;person and address that can captivate a woman.”&#10;&#10;“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of&#10;Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”&#10;&#10;“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be&#10;their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,&#10;till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what&#10;Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every&#10;sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is&#10;as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”&#10;&#10;“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity&#10;as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.&#10;&#10;“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,&#10;of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at&#10;Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved&#10;with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other&#10;circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to&#10;relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From&#10;what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,&#10;reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He&#10;must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found&#10;her.”&#10;&#10;“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you&#10;and Jane seem so well to understand?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw&#10;so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was&#10;ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire&#10;was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the&#10;case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it&#10;necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could&#10;it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the&#10;neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was&#10;settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening&#10;her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be&#10;in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a&#10;consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far&#10;enough from my thoughts.”&#10;&#10;“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I&#10;suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”&#10;&#10;“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either&#10;side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware&#10;that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first&#10;he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all&#10;were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for&#10;the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular&#10;attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and&#10;wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,&#10;who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”&#10;&#10;                          * * * * *&#10;&#10;It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added&#10;to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by&#10;its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during&#10;the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.&#10;Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find&#10;no interval of ease or forgetfulness.&#10;&#10;They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night&#10;on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a&#10;comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied&#10;by long expectations.&#10;&#10;The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing&#10;on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the&#10;carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their&#10;faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of&#10;capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,&#10;hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her&#10;mother’s apartment, immediately met her.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the&#10;eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been&#10;heard of the fugitives.&#10;&#10;“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope&#10;everything will be well.”&#10;&#10;“Is my father in town?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”&#10;&#10;“And have you heard from him often?”&#10;&#10;“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say&#10;that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I&#10;particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write&#10;again till he had something of importance to mention.”&#10;&#10;“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”&#10;&#10;“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly&#10;shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you&#10;all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank&#10;Heaven, are quite well.”&#10;&#10;“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you&#10;must have gone through!”&#10;&#10;Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their&#10;conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were&#10;engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach&#10;of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and&#10;thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.&#10;&#10;When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth&#10;had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon&#10;found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of&#10;good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet&#10;deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that&#10;every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,&#10;to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’&#10;conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with&#10;tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous&#10;conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;&#10;blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the&#10;errors of her daughter must principally be owing.&#10;&#10;“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,&#10;with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia&#10;had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out&#10;of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their&#10;side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been&#10;well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the&#10;charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!&#10;And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,&#10;wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become&#10;of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his&#10;grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we&#10;shall do.”&#10;&#10;They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after&#10;general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her&#10;that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.&#10;Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.&#10;&#10;“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be&#10;prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.&#10;It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we&#10;may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,&#10;and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as&#10;lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make&#10;him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult&#10;together as to what is to be done.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I&#10;could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,&#10;wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them&#10;marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but&#10;tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,&#10;after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.&#10;Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my&#10;wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such&#10;spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that&#10;I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to&#10;give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does&#10;not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I&#10;know you will contrive it all.”&#10;&#10;But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours&#10;in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well&#10;in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till&#10;dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on&#10;the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.&#10;&#10;Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real&#10;occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to&#10;oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her&#10;tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it&#10;better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could&#10;most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the&#10;subject.&#10;&#10;In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been&#10;too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance&#10;before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The&#10;faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible&#10;in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger&#10;which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of&#10;fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was&#10;mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance&#10;of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:&#10;&#10;“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.&#10;But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of&#10;each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”&#10;&#10;Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,&#10;“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful&#10;lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one&#10;false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less&#10;brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in&#10;her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed&#10;to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such&#10;kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.&#10;&#10;In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for&#10;half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of&#10;the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to&#10;satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel&#10;of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss&#10;Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued&#10;the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which&#10;I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel&#10;Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement&#10;took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”&#10;&#10;“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,&#10;especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so&#10;grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He&#10;_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had&#10;any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension&#10;first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”&#10;&#10;“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of&#10;their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”&#10;&#10;“Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of&#10;their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not&#10;repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am&#10;inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”&#10;&#10;“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a&#10;doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”&#10;&#10;“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt&#10;a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him&#10;in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite&#10;right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how&#10;imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural&#10;triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter&#10;she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their&#10;being in love with each other, many weeks.”&#10;&#10;“But not before they went to Brighton?”&#10;&#10;“No, I believe not.”&#10;&#10;“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does&#10;he know his real character?”&#10;&#10;“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly&#10;did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad&#10;affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;&#10;but I hope this may be false.”&#10;&#10;“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,&#10;this could not have happened!”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose&#10;the former faults of any person without knowing what their present&#10;feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”&#10;&#10;“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his&#10;wife?”&#10;&#10;“He brought it with him for us to see.”&#10;&#10;Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These&#10;were the contents:&#10;&#10;“MY DEAR HARRIET,&#10;&#10;“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help&#10;laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am&#10;missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,&#10;I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I&#10;love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think&#10;it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my&#10;going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,&#10;when I write to them and sign my name ‘Lydia Wickham.’ What a good joke&#10;it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to&#10;Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.&#10;Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will&#10;dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall&#10;send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell&#10;Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are&#10;packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will&#10;drink to our good journey.&#10;&#10;“Your affectionate friend,&#10;&#10;“LYDIA BENNET.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had&#10;finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!&#10;But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their&#10;journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her&#10;side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”&#10;&#10;“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten&#10;minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in&#10;such confusion!”&#10;&#10;“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who&#10;did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”&#10;&#10;“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is&#10;very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to&#10;give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so&#10;much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen&#10;almost took from me my faculties.”&#10;&#10;“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look&#10;well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety&#10;upon yourself alone.”&#10;&#10;“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every&#10;fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.&#10;Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours&#10;of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn&#10;on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till&#10;Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And&#10;Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to&#10;condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters’, if&#10;they should be of use to us.”&#10;&#10;“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she&#10;_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see&#10;too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence&#10;insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”&#10;&#10;She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had&#10;intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.&#10;&#10;“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where&#10;they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could&#10;be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the&#10;number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come&#10;with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a&#10;gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might&#10;be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow&#10;discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he&#10;determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible&#10;to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any&#10;other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,&#10;and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding&#10;out even so much as this.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 48&#10;&#10;&#10;The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next&#10;morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.&#10;His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and&#10;dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.&#10;They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to&#10;send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.&#10;Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.&#10;&#10;When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant&#10;information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,&#10;to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,&#10;to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only&#10;security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few&#10;days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable&#10;to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a&#10;great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also&#10;visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of&#10;cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without&#10;reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,&#10;she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found&#10;them.&#10;&#10;All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months&#10;before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt&#10;to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with&#10;the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.&#10;Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;&#10;and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the&#10;appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above&#10;half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of&#10;her sister’s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less&#10;of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come&#10;when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely&#10;despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of&#10;them.&#10;&#10;Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a&#10;letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately&#10;found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;&#10;that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,&#10;but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now&#10;determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet&#10;thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first&#10;coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself&#10;did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was&#10;eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.&#10;Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised&#10;to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:&#10;&#10;“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if&#10;possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,&#10;whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to&#10;know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were&#10;anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a&#10;clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have&#10;nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in&#10;his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,&#10;Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any&#10;other person.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her&#10;authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information&#10;of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never&#10;heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both&#10;of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of&#10;his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;&#10;and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application&#10;was a something to look forward to.&#10;&#10;Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious&#10;part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters&#10;was the grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,&#10;whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every&#10;succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.&#10;&#10;But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for&#10;their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane&#10;had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,&#10;she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his&#10;letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as&#10;follows:&#10;&#10;“MY DEAR SIR,&#10;&#10;“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation&#10;in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now&#10;suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from&#10;Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself&#10;sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in&#10;your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because&#10;proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be&#10;wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that&#10;may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the&#10;most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would&#10;have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to&#10;be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte&#10;informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has&#10;proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,&#10;for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think&#10;that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be&#10;guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,&#10;you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined&#10;by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to&#10;whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that&#10;this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of&#10;all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,&#10;will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads&#10;me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event&#10;of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved&#10;in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to&#10;console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child&#10;from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her&#10;own heinous offense.&#10;&#10;“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from&#10;Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.&#10;It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he&#10;kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one&#10;living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he&#10;had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of&#10;particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,&#10;who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the&#10;wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for&#10;secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations, for&#10;it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a&#10;very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a&#10;thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.&#10;He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more&#10;formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars&#10;from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”&#10; she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their&#10;father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered&#10;spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded&#10;to his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family, and&#10;leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable&#10;for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did&#10;not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering&#10;what her anxiety for his life had been before.&#10;&#10;“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he&#10;will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,&#10;and make him marry her, if he comes away?”&#10;&#10;As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she&#10;and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet&#10;came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their&#10;journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her&#10;Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His&#10;name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and&#10;the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their&#10;being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had&#10;received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.&#10;&#10;The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for&#10;the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be&#10;fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time&#10;tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware&#10;that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of&#10;Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,&#10;one sleepless night out of two.&#10;&#10;When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual&#10;philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the&#10;habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him&#10;away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of&#10;it.&#10;&#10;It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that&#10;Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly&#10;expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say&#10;nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,&#10;and I ought to feel it.”&#10;&#10;“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone&#10;to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have&#10;been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.&#10;It will pass away soon enough.”&#10;&#10;“Do you suppose them to be in London?”&#10;&#10;“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”&#10;&#10;“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.&#10;&#10;“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there&#10;will probably be of some duration.”&#10;&#10;Then after a short silence he continued:&#10;&#10;“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me&#10;last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”&#10;&#10;They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s&#10;tea.&#10;&#10;“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an&#10;elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my&#10;library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as&#10;I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”&#10;&#10;“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should&#10;ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”&#10;&#10;“_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne&#10;for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and&#10;you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into&#10;my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be&#10;absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.&#10;And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have&#10;spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”&#10;&#10;Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.&#10;&#10;“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good&#10;girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of&#10;them.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 49&#10;&#10;&#10;Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking&#10;together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper&#10;coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their&#10;mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,&#10;when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,&#10;madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some&#10;good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”&#10;&#10;“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”&#10;&#10;“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know&#10;there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here&#10;this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”&#10;&#10;Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They&#10;ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the&#10;library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of&#10;seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the&#10;butler, who said:&#10;&#10;“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the&#10;little copse.”&#10;&#10;Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once&#10;more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately&#10;pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.&#10;&#10;Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as&#10;Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,&#10;came up with him, and eagerly cried out:&#10;&#10;“Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”&#10;&#10;“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”&#10;&#10;“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”&#10;&#10;“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from&#10;his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.&#10;&#10;“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is&#10;about.”&#10;&#10;“Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.&#10;&#10;“MY DEAR BROTHER,&#10;&#10;“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,&#10;upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you&#10;left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of&#10;London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough&#10;to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--”&#10;&#10;“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth read on:&#10;&#10;“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there&#10;was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the&#10;engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will&#10;not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure&#10;to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand&#10;pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and&#10;my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,&#10;during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions&#10;which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,&#10;as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by&#10;express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You&#10;will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s&#10;circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.&#10;The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there&#10;will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to&#10;settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude&#10;will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout&#10;the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to&#10;Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the&#10;smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at&#10;Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as&#10;fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it&#10;best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope&#10;you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as&#10;anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,&#10;&#10;“EDW. GARDINER.”&#10;&#10;“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be&#10;possible that he will marry her?”&#10;&#10;“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her&#10;sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”&#10;&#10;“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“No; but it must be done soon.”&#10;&#10;Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he&#10;wrote.&#10;&#10;“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.&#10;Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”&#10;&#10;“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble&#10;yourself.”&#10;&#10;“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”&#10;&#10;And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.&#10;&#10;“And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be&#10;complied with.”&#10;&#10;“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”&#10;&#10;“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”&#10;&#10;“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there&#10;are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money&#10;your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever&#10;to pay him.”&#10;&#10;“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”&#10;&#10;“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a&#10;temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am&#10;gone.”&#10;&#10;“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me&#10;before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!&#10;it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has&#10;distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”&#10;&#10;“No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing&#10;less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,&#10;in the very beginning of our relationship.”&#10;&#10;“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be&#10;repaid?”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued&#10;silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the&#10;library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.&#10;&#10;“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they&#10;were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be&#10;thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,&#10;and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”&#10;&#10;“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would&#10;not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind&#10;uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten&#10;thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children&#10;of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand&#10;pounds?”&#10;&#10;“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said&#10;Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall&#10;exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has&#10;not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never&#10;be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal&#10;protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as&#10;years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is&#10;actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,&#10;she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she&#10;first sees my aunt!”&#10;&#10;“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said&#10;Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to&#10;marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of&#10;thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself&#10;they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in&#10;time make their past imprudence forgotten.”&#10;&#10;“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor&#10;I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”&#10;&#10;It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood&#10;perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,&#10;therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make&#10;it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly&#10;replied:&#10;&#10;“Just as you please.”&#10;&#10;“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”&#10;&#10;“Take whatever you like, and get away.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs&#10;together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication&#10;would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,&#10;the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As&#10;soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon&#10;married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its&#10;exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she&#10;had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter&#10;would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her&#10;felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.&#10;&#10;“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will&#10;be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!&#10;My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage&#10;everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the&#10;clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about&#10;them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him&#10;how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,&#10;Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear&#10;Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”&#10;&#10;Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of&#10;these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.&#10;Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.&#10;&#10;“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great&#10;measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to&#10;assist Mr. Wickham with money.”&#10;&#10;“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but&#10;her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children&#10;must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have&#10;ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!&#10;In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well&#10;it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in&#10;such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and&#10;you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money&#10;afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”&#10;&#10;She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and&#10;cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had&#10;not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her&#10;father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,&#10;would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite&#10;so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.&#10;&#10;“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the&#10;good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call&#10;on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.&#10;An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do&#10;anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you&#10;heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall&#10;all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her&#10;congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took&#10;refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.&#10;&#10;Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was&#10;no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in&#10;looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could&#10;be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had&#10;feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had&#10;gained.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 50&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,&#10;instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for&#10;the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived&#10;him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that&#10;respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever&#10;of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of&#10;prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be&#10;her husband might then have rested in its proper place.&#10;&#10;He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone&#10;should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he&#10;was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,&#10;and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.&#10;&#10;When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly&#10;useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join&#10;in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow&#10;and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters&#10;successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.&#10;Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he&#10;would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then&#10;too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her&#10;husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their&#10;income.&#10;&#10;Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and&#10;the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the&#10;latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with&#10;regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet&#10;could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In&#10;terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,&#10;though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect&#10;approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the&#10;engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed&#10;that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would&#10;be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present&#10;arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the&#10;hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket&#10;allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her&#10;through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within&#10;that sum.&#10;&#10;That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was&#10;another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as&#10;little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports&#10;of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he&#10;naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon&#10;dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick&#10;in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he&#10;was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any&#10;message to her.&#10;&#10;The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate&#10;speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent&#10;philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage&#10;of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the&#10;happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant&#10;farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the&#10;good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from&#10;all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit&#10;in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery&#10;was considered certain.&#10;&#10;It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this&#10;happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in&#10;spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her&#10;triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object&#10;of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of&#10;accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those&#10;attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and&#10;servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a&#10;proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering&#10;what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and&#10;importance.&#10;&#10;“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the&#10;great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is&#10;too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for&#10;Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”&#10;&#10;Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the&#10;servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.&#10;Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and&#10;daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this&#10;neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the&#10;impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”&#10;&#10;A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It&#10;soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,&#10;that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his&#10;daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of&#10;affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend&#10;it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable&#10;resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her&#10;marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe&#10;possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new&#10;clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of&#10;shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they&#10;took place.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of&#10;the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for&#10;her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the&#10;proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its&#10;unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the&#10;spot.&#10;&#10;She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were&#10;few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;&#10;but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s&#10;frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear&#10;of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,&#10;there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been&#10;concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that&#10;Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other&#10;objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the&#10;nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.&#10;&#10;From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The&#10;wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his&#10;feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a&#10;blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she&#10;hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no&#10;longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there&#10;seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that&#10;she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they&#10;should meet.&#10;&#10;What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the&#10;proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now&#10;have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she&#10;doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,&#10;there must be a triumph.&#10;&#10;She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in&#10;disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and&#10;temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It&#10;was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease&#10;and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;&#10;and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she&#10;must have received benefit of greater importance.&#10;&#10;But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what&#10;connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and&#10;precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their&#10;family.&#10;&#10;How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,&#10;she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could&#10;belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions&#10;were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.&#10;&#10;                          * * * * *&#10;&#10;Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s&#10;acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to&#10;promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties&#10;that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal&#10;purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved&#10;on quitting the militia.&#10;&#10;“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as&#10;his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in&#10;considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on&#10;his account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into&#10;the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who&#10;are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an&#10;ensigncy in General ----‘s regiment, now quartered in the North. It&#10;is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He&#10;promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each&#10;have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have&#10;written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,&#10;and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham&#10;in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I&#10;have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying&#10;similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin&#10;a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I&#10;hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,&#10;and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,&#10;unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.&#10;Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she&#10;leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to&#10;you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,&#10;&#10;“E. GARDINER.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s removal&#10;from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet&#10;was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in the North,&#10;just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,&#10;for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in&#10;Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a&#10;pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted&#10;with everybody, and had so many favourites.&#10;&#10;“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking&#10;to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she&#10;likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----‘s&#10;regiment.”&#10;&#10;His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being&#10;admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,&#10;received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,&#10;who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and&#10;consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,&#10;urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her&#10;and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was&#10;prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their&#10;mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show&#10;her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the&#10;North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent&#10;his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as&#10;the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was&#10;surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and&#10;had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would&#10;have been the last object of her wishes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 51&#10;&#10;&#10;Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her&#10;probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to&#10;meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their&#10;arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,&#10;who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she&#10;been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister&#10;must endure.&#10;&#10;They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive&#10;them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to&#10;the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,&#10;anxious, uneasy.&#10;&#10;Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and&#10;she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and&#10;welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,&#10;to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an&#10;alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.&#10;&#10;Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite&#10;so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely&#10;opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was&#10;enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet&#10;was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,&#10;and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their&#10;congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly&#10;round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and&#10;observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been&#10;there.&#10;&#10;Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners&#10;were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been&#10;exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he&#10;claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had&#10;not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,&#10;resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence&#10;of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the&#10;two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.&#10;&#10;There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither&#10;of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near&#10;Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,&#10;with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her&#10;replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the&#10;world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led&#10;voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for&#10;the world.&#10;&#10;“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;&#10;it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things&#10;enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure&#10;I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I&#10;thought it would be very good fun if I was.”&#10;&#10;Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked&#10;expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of&#10;which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the&#10;people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;&#10;and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he&#10;should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took&#10;off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that&#10;he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;&#10;and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to&#10;the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with&#10;anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say&#10;to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go&#10;lower, because I am a married woman.”&#10;&#10;It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment&#10;from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good&#10;spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and&#10;all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”&#10; by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her&#10;ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.&#10;&#10;“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast&#10;room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I&#10;am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half&#10;my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get&#10;husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”&#10;&#10;“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don’t&#10;at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all&#10;things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We&#10;shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some&#10;balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”&#10;&#10;“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.&#10;&#10;“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters&#10;behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the&#10;winter is over.”&#10;&#10;“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not&#10;particularly like your way of getting husbands.”&#10;&#10;Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham&#10;had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join&#10;his regiment at the end of a fortnight.&#10;&#10;No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and&#10;she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and&#10;having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to&#10;all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did&#10;think, than such as did not.&#10;&#10;Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected&#10;to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her&#10;present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that&#10;their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather&#10;than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring&#10;for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain&#10;that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and&#10;if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity&#10;of having a companion.&#10;&#10;Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every&#10;occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every&#10;thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on&#10;the first of September, than any body else in the country.&#10;&#10;One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two&#10;elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:&#10;&#10;“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You&#10;were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you&#10;curious to hear how it was managed?”&#10;&#10;“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said&#10;on the subject.”&#10;&#10;“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were&#10;married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in&#10;that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven&#10;o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others&#10;were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in&#10;such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to&#10;put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was&#10;my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as&#10;if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in&#10;ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed&#10;to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”&#10;&#10;“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never&#10;be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt&#10;were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe&#10;me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a&#10;fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was&#10;rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so&#10;just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon&#10;business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once&#10;they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I&#10;did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we&#10;were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he&#10;came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However,&#10;I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the&#10;wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”&#10;&#10;“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious&#10;me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised&#10;them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”&#10;&#10;“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the&#10;subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will&#10;ask you no questions.”&#10;&#10;“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you&#10;all, and then Wickham would be angry.”&#10;&#10;On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her&#10;power, by running away.&#10;&#10;But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least&#10;it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at&#10;her sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,&#10;where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.&#10;Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her&#10;brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as&#10;placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She&#10;could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,&#10;wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what&#10;Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been&#10;intended.&#10;&#10;“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be&#10;to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively&#10;speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such&#10;a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,&#10;for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems&#10;to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with&#10;ignorance.”&#10;&#10;“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished&#10;the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable&#10;manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it&#10;out.”&#10;&#10;Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to&#10;Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad&#10;of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any&#10;satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 52&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as&#10;soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it&#10;than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to&#10;be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to&#10;be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not&#10;contain a denial.&#10;&#10;“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.&#10;&#10;“MY DEAR NIECE,&#10;&#10;“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning&#10;to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise&#10;what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your&#10;application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don’t think me angry,&#10;however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such&#10;inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to&#10;understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised&#10;as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned&#10;would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really&#10;innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.&#10;&#10;“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most&#10;unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several&#10;hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so&#10;dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.&#10;Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,&#10;and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,&#10;Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day&#10;after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for&#10;them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to&#10;himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to&#10;make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide&#10;in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and&#10;confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private&#10;actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He&#10;called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy&#10;an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_&#10;motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days&#10;in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to&#10;direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness&#10;of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.&#10;&#10;“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago&#10;governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause&#10;of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large&#10;house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting&#10;lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with&#10;Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to&#10;town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he&#10;wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and&#10;corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.&#10;Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had&#10;she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up&#10;their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the&#10;wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and&#10;afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he&#10;acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful&#10;situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed&#10;on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But&#10;he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared&#10;for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear&#10;of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or&#10;other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,&#10;it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,&#10;in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never&#10;been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,&#10;on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and&#10;scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her&#10;own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as&#10;to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He&#10;must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have&#10;nothing to live on.&#10;&#10;“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though&#10;Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able&#10;to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by&#10;marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still&#10;cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in&#10;some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely&#10;to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.&#10;&#10;“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of&#10;course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be&#10;reasonable.&#10;&#10;“Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to&#10;make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch&#10;street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be&#10;seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was&#10;still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge&#10;your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your&#10;uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the&#10;departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next&#10;day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.&#10;&#10;“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,&#10;and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.&#10;&#10;“They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all&#10;settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to&#10;Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that&#10;obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been&#10;accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.&#10;Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and&#10;I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your&#10;uncle would most readily have settled the whole.&#10;&#10;“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either&#10;the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle&#10;was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his&#10;niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,&#10;which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter&#10;this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation&#10;that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where&#10;it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane&#10;at most.&#10;&#10;“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young&#10;people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably&#10;more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own&#10;settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all&#10;this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It&#10;was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that&#10;Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he&#10;had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth&#10;in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_ reserve,&#10;can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,&#10;my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would&#10;never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another&#10;interest_ in the affair.&#10;&#10;“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who&#10;were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in&#10;London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were&#10;then to receive the last finish.&#10;&#10;“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which&#10;you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not&#10;afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant&#10;admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I&#10;knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was&#10;satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not&#10;perceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming&#10;home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell&#10;you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most&#10;serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had&#10;done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she&#10;heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was&#10;sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and&#10;Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.&#10;&#10;“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,&#10;attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave&#10;town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my&#10;dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold&#10;enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,&#10;in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His&#10;understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little&#10;more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach&#10;him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But&#10;slyness seems the fashion.&#10;&#10;“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not&#10;punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy&#10;till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little&#10;pair of ponies, would be the very thing.&#10;&#10;“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half&#10;hour.&#10;&#10;“Yours, very sincerely,&#10;&#10;“M. GARDINER.”&#10;&#10;The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,&#10;in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the&#10;greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had&#10;produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s&#10;match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too&#10;great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the&#10;pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!&#10;He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all&#10;the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which&#10;supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and&#10;despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason&#10;with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to&#10;avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had&#10;done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her&#10;heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly&#10;checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity&#10;was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for&#10;a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so&#10;natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law&#10;of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,&#10;to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had&#10;given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary&#10;stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been&#10;wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and&#10;though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she&#10;could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist&#10;his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially&#10;concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were&#10;under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They&#10;owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!&#10;how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever&#10;encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For&#10;herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause&#10;of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.&#10;She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It&#10;was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some&#10;pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she&#10;and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted&#10;between Mr. Darcy and herself.&#10;&#10;She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s&#10;approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was&#10;overtaken by Wickham.&#10;&#10;“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,&#10;as he joined her.&#10;&#10;“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow&#10;that the interruption must be unwelcome.”&#10;&#10;“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and&#10;now we are better.”&#10;&#10;“True. Are the others coming out?”&#10;&#10;“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to&#10;Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that&#10;you have actually seen Pemberley.”&#10;&#10;She replied in the affirmative.&#10;&#10;“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much&#10;for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the&#10;old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of&#10;me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, she did.”&#10;&#10;“And what did she say?”&#10;&#10;“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned&#10;out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely&#10;misrepresented.”&#10;&#10;“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had&#10;silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:&#10;&#10;“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other&#10;several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”&#10;&#10;“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said&#10;Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this&#10;time of year.”&#10;&#10;“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I&#10;understood from the Gardiners that you had.”&#10;&#10;“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”&#10;&#10;“And do you like her?”&#10;&#10;“Very much.”&#10;&#10;“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year&#10;or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad&#10;you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”&#10;&#10;“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”&#10;&#10;“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”&#10;&#10;“I do not recollect that we did.”&#10;&#10;“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A&#10;most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited&#10;me in every respect.”&#10;&#10;“How should you have liked making sermons?”&#10;&#10;“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,&#10;and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to&#10;repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The&#10;quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas&#10;of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the&#10;circumstance, when you were in Kent?”&#10;&#10;“I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was&#10;left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”&#10;&#10;“You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the&#10;first, you may remember.”&#10;&#10;“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not&#10;so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually&#10;declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business&#10;had been compromised accordingly.”&#10;&#10;“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember&#10;what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”&#10;&#10;They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast&#10;to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,&#10;she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:&#10;&#10;“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let&#10;us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one&#10;mind.”&#10;&#10;She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though&#10;he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 53&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he&#10;never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,&#10;by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she&#10;had said enough to keep him quiet.&#10;&#10;The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was&#10;forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means&#10;entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to&#10;continue at least a twelvemonth.&#10;&#10;“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”&#10;&#10;“Write to me very often, my dear.”&#10;&#10;“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for&#10;writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to&#10;do.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He&#10;smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.&#10;&#10;“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of&#10;the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to&#10;us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas&#10;himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”&#10;&#10;The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.&#10;&#10;“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with&#10;one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”&#10;&#10;“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said&#10;Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are&#10;single.”&#10;&#10;“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,&#10;but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If&#10;that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”&#10;&#10;But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly&#10;relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an&#10;article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper&#10;at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her&#10;master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several&#10;weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and&#10;smiled and shook her head by turns.&#10;&#10;“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.&#10;Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not&#10;that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am&#10;sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome&#10;to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?&#10;But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to&#10;mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”&#10;&#10;“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in&#10;Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose&#10;to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He&#10;comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was&#10;going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on&#10;Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing&#10;colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to&#10;Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:&#10;&#10;“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present&#10;report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t imagine it was from&#10;any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that&#10;I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect&#10;me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes&#10;alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of&#10;_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in&#10;Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no&#10;other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial&#10;to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming&#10;there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come&#10;without it.&#10;&#10;“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot&#10;come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this&#10;speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”&#10;&#10;In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her&#10;feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily&#10;perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,&#10;more unequal, than she had often seen them.&#10;&#10;The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,&#10;about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.&#10;&#10;“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you&#10;will wait on him of course.”&#10;&#10;“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I&#10;went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in&#10;nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”&#10;&#10;His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention&#10;would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to&#10;Netherfield.&#10;&#10;“‘Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,&#10;let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours&#10;in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back&#10;again.”&#10;&#10;“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait&#10;on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I&#10;am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will&#10;make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for&#10;him.”&#10;&#10;Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her&#10;husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her&#10;neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before&#10;_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--&#10;&#10;“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It&#10;would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can&#10;hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;&#10;but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she&#10;says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”&#10;&#10;“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it&#10;is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction&#10;of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have&#10;always so much.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,&#10;contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety&#10;and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted&#10;the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;&#10;hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his&#10;arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,&#10;enter the paddock and ride towards the house.&#10;&#10;Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely&#10;kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went&#10;to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down&#10;again by her sister.&#10;&#10;“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”&#10;&#10;“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not&#10;know.”&#10;&#10;“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with&#10;him before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”&#10;&#10;“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of&#10;Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must&#10;say that I hate the very sight of him.”&#10;&#10;Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little&#10;of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness&#10;which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time&#10;after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable&#10;enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their&#10;mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be&#10;civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either&#10;of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be&#10;suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.&#10;Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.&#10;To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,&#10;and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive&#10;information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted&#10;for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an&#10;interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as&#10;what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his&#10;coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,&#10;was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered&#10;behaviour in Derbyshire.&#10;&#10;The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a&#10;minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to&#10;her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and&#10;wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.&#10;&#10;“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early&#10;enough for expectation.”&#10;&#10;She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to&#10;lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of&#10;her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little&#10;paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the&#10;gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with&#10;tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any&#10;symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down&#10;again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She&#10;had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,&#10;she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as&#10;she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s&#10;presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but&#10;not an improbable, conjecture.&#10;&#10;Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period&#10;saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.&#10;Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,&#10;especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of&#10;her curtsey and address to his friend.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter&#10;the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,&#10;was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill&#10;applied.&#10;&#10;Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question&#10;which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He&#10;was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but&#10;it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,&#10;when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without&#10;bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist&#10;the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often&#10;found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but&#10;the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when&#10;they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry&#10;with herself for being so.&#10;&#10;“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”&#10;&#10;She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to&#10;him she had hardly courage to speak.&#10;&#10;She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.&#10;&#10;“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.&#10;&#10;He readily agreed to it.&#10;&#10;“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say&#10;you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope&#10;it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,&#10;since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my&#10;own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have&#10;seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;&#10;though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,&#10;George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a&#10;syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.&#10;It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to&#10;make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”&#10;&#10;Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth&#10;dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could&#10;not tell.&#10;&#10;“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”&#10; continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very&#10;hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to&#10;Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay&#10;I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have&#10;heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the&#10;regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so&#10;many as he deserves.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such&#10;misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,&#10;however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually&#10;done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in&#10;the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.&#10;&#10;“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,&#10;“I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.&#10;Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and&#10;will save all the best of the covies for you.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious&#10;attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had&#10;flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be&#10;hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt&#10;that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for&#10;moments of such painful confusion.&#10;&#10;“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to&#10;be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure&#10;that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either&#10;one or the other again!”&#10;&#10;Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no&#10;compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing&#10;how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her&#10;former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;&#10;but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He&#10;found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and&#10;as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no&#10;difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded&#10;that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,&#10;that she did not always know when she was silent.&#10;&#10;When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her&#10;intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at&#10;Longbourn in a few days time.&#10;&#10;“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when&#10;you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with&#10;us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure&#10;you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep&#10;your engagement.”&#10;&#10;Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of&#10;his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine&#10;there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did&#10;not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man&#10;on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride&#10;of one who had ten thousand a year.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 54&#10;&#10;&#10;As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;&#10;or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that&#10;must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.&#10;&#10;“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,&#10;“did he come at all?”&#10;&#10;She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.&#10;&#10;“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when&#10;he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If&#10;he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will&#10;think no more about him.”&#10;&#10;Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach&#10;of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her&#10;better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly&#10;easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by&#10;his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly&#10;seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent&#10;acquaintance.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane,&#10;take care.”&#10;&#10;“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”&#10;&#10;“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with&#10;you as ever.”&#10;&#10;                          * * * * *&#10;&#10;They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in&#10;the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good&#10;humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had&#10;revived.&#10;&#10;On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two&#10;who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality&#10;as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the&#10;dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take&#10;the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by&#10;her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore&#10;to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to&#10;hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was&#10;decided. He placed himself by her.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.&#10;He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that&#10;Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes&#10;likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing&#10;alarm.&#10;&#10;His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an&#10;admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded&#10;Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his&#10;own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the&#10;consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It&#10;gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in&#10;no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table&#10;could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little&#10;such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to&#10;advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but&#10;she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and&#10;cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness,&#10;made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;&#10;and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell&#10;him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the&#10;family.&#10;&#10;She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of&#10;bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away&#10;without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than&#10;the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious&#10;and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the&#10;gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her&#10;uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all&#10;her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.&#10;&#10;“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for&#10;ever.”&#10;&#10;The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have&#10;answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,&#10;where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,&#10;in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her&#10;which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of&#10;the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:&#10;&#10;“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;&#10;do we?”&#10;&#10;Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with&#10;her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough&#10;to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for&#10;being so silly!&#10;&#10;“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to&#10;expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not&#10;protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?&#10;There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”&#10;&#10;She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup&#10;himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:&#10;&#10;“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”&#10;&#10;“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”&#10;&#10;“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,&#10;these three weeks.”&#10;&#10;She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse&#10;with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for&#10;some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering&#10;to Elizabeth again, he walked away.&#10;&#10;When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies&#10;all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,&#10;when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her&#10;mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated&#10;with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.&#10;They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had&#10;nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side&#10;of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to&#10;supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the&#10;others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.&#10;&#10;“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What&#10;say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,&#10;I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The&#10;venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so&#10;fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the&#10;Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges&#10;were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French&#10;cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater&#10;beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And&#10;what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her&#10;at Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good&#10;a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,&#10;and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of&#10;Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at&#10;last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy&#10;humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at&#10;not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.&#10;&#10;“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The&#10;party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we&#10;may often meet again.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth smiled.&#10;&#10;“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.&#10;I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an&#10;agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am&#10;perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had&#10;any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed&#10;with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally&#10;pleasing, than any other man.”&#10;&#10;“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and&#10;are provoking me to it every moment.”&#10;&#10;“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”&#10;&#10;“And how impossible in others!”&#10;&#10;“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I&#10;acknowledge?”&#10;&#10;“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to&#10;instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive&#10;me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 55&#10;&#10;&#10;A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His&#10;friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in&#10;ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably&#10;good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many&#10;expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.&#10;&#10;“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”&#10;&#10;He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would&#10;give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.&#10;&#10;“Can you come to-morrow?”&#10;&#10;Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was&#10;accepted with alacrity.&#10;&#10;He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them&#10;dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her dressing&#10;gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:&#10;&#10;“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is&#10;come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss&#10;Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss&#10;Lizzy’s hair.”&#10;&#10;“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is&#10;forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!&#10;Where is your sash, my dear?”&#10;&#10;But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down&#10;without one of her sisters.&#10;&#10;The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the&#10;evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his&#10;custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of&#10;the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at&#10;Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any&#10;impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last&#10;Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do&#10;you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”&#10;&#10;“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still&#10;five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she&#10;suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to&#10;speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look&#10;at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her&#10;entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.&#10;Bennet half-opened the door and called out:&#10;&#10;“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was forced to go.&#10;&#10;“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as&#10;soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in&#10;my dressing-room.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained&#10;quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned&#10;into the drawing-room.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every&#10;thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His&#10;ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their&#10;evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the&#10;mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command&#10;of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.&#10;&#10;He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went&#10;away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.&#10;Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.&#10;&#10;After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed&#10;between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in&#10;the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy&#10;returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably&#10;persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s&#10;concurrence.&#10;&#10;Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent&#10;the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more&#10;agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption&#10;or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into&#10;silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the&#10;other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;&#10;and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get&#10;every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter&#10;to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;&#10;for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be&#10;wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.&#10;&#10;But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she&#10;saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother&#10;had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her&#10;sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in&#10;earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of&#10;both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would&#10;have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she&#10;thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and&#10;Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as&#10;well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few&#10;words to her sister, ran out of the room.&#10;&#10;Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give&#10;pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest&#10;emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.&#10;&#10;“‘Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!&#10;why is not everybody as happy?”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,&#10;a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of&#10;kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not&#10;allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be&#10;said for the present.&#10;&#10;“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any&#10;account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it&#10;from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to&#10;know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear&#10;family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”&#10;&#10;She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the&#10;card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease&#10;with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many&#10;previous months of suspense and vexation.&#10;&#10;“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious&#10;circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the&#10;happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”&#10;&#10;In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her&#10;father had been short and to the purpose.&#10;&#10;“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.&#10;&#10;“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”&#10;&#10;He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes&#10;and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed&#10;her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with&#10;great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen&#10;to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;&#10;and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his&#10;expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for&#10;basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of&#10;Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and&#10;himself.&#10;&#10;It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of&#10;Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as&#10;made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped&#10;her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or&#10;speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,&#10;though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when&#10;Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed&#10;how really happy he was.&#10;&#10;Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their&#10;visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he&#10;turned to his daughter, and said:&#10;&#10;“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”&#10;&#10;Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his&#10;goodness.&#10;&#10;“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in&#10;thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your&#10;doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are&#10;each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so&#10;easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will&#10;always exceed your income.”&#10;&#10;“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be&#10;unpardonable in me.”&#10;&#10;“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you&#10;talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely&#10;more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so&#10;happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it&#10;would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not&#10;be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when&#10;he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was&#10;that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that&#10;ever was seen!”&#10;&#10;Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her&#10;favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger&#10;sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness&#10;which she might in future be able to dispense.&#10;&#10;Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty&#10;begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.&#10;&#10;Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;&#10;coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after&#10;supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough&#10;detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself&#10;obliged to accept.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for&#10;while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;&#10;but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours&#10;of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he&#10;always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of&#10;her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of&#10;relief.&#10;&#10;“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he&#10;was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed&#10;it possible.”&#10;&#10;“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for&#10;it?”&#10;&#10;“It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no friends to&#10;his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have&#10;chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,&#10;as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will&#10;learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we&#10;can never be what we once were to each other.”&#10;&#10;“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever&#10;heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again&#10;the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”&#10;&#10;“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,&#10;he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being&#10;indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”&#10;&#10;“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his&#10;modesty.”&#10;&#10;This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and&#10;the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased&#10;to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,&#10;though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she&#10;knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.&#10;&#10;“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried&#10;Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed&#10;above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but&#10;such another man for you!”&#10;&#10;“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as&#10;you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your&#10;happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very&#10;good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”&#10;&#10;The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a&#10;secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,&#10;and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her&#10;neighbours in Meryton.&#10;&#10;The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the&#10;world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,&#10;they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 56&#10;&#10;&#10;One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been&#10;formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the&#10;dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the&#10;sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up&#10;the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the&#10;equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses&#10;were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who&#10;preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that&#10;somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid&#10;the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the&#10;shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three&#10;continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown&#10;open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&#10;&#10;They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their&#10;astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.&#10;Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even&#10;inferior to what Elizabeth felt.&#10;&#10;She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no&#10;other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the&#10;head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her&#10;name to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though no request of&#10;introduction had been made.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such&#10;high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting&#10;for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,&#10;&#10;“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your&#10;mother.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.&#10;&#10;“And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.&#10;“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,&#10;and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man&#10;who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”&#10;&#10;“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short&#10;silence.&#10;&#10;“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I&#10;assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”&#10;&#10;“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in&#10;summer; the windows are full west.”&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then&#10;added:&#10;&#10;“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and&#10;Mrs. Collins well.”&#10;&#10;“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from&#10;Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no&#10;letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some&#10;refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,&#10;declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,&#10;&#10;“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness&#10;on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you&#10;will favour me with your company.”&#10;&#10;“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the&#10;different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,&#10;attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the&#10;hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and&#10;drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent&#10;looking rooms, walked on.&#10;&#10;Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her&#10;waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk&#10;that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for&#10;conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and&#10;disagreeable.&#10;&#10;“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in&#10;her face.&#10;&#10;As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following&#10;manner:--&#10;&#10;“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my&#10;journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I&#10;come.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.&#10;&#10;“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account&#10;for the honour of seeing you here.”&#10;&#10;“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to&#10;know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may&#10;choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been&#10;celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such&#10;moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most&#10;alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your&#10;sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that&#10;you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon&#10;afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I&#10;_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him&#10;so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved&#10;on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to&#10;you.”&#10;&#10;“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring&#10;with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming&#10;so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”&#10;&#10;“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”&#10;&#10;“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth&#10;coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report&#10;is in existence.”&#10;&#10;“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been&#10;industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a&#10;report is spread abroad?”&#10;&#10;“I never heard that it was.”&#10;&#10;“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”&#10;&#10;“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may&#10;ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”&#10;&#10;“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has&#10;he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”&#10;&#10;“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”&#10;&#10;“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his&#10;reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,&#10;have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You&#10;may have drawn him in.”&#10;&#10;“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”&#10;&#10;“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such&#10;language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,&#10;and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”&#10;&#10;“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,&#10;ever induce me to be explicit.”&#10;&#10;“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the&#10;presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is&#10;engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”&#10;&#10;“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will&#10;make an offer to me.”&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:&#10;&#10;“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,&#10;they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of&#10;_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned&#10;the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would&#10;be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of&#10;inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to&#10;the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his&#10;tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of&#10;propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest&#10;hours he was destined for his cousin?”&#10;&#10;“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is&#10;no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not&#10;be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to&#10;marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the&#10;marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither&#10;by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make&#10;another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”&#10;&#10;“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,&#10;Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or&#10;friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will&#10;be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.&#10;Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned&#10;by any of us.”&#10;&#10;“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.&#10;Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily&#10;attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause&#10;to repine.”&#10;&#10;“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude&#10;for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that&#10;score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came&#10;here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will&#10;I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s&#10;whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”&#10;&#10;“_That_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;&#10;but it will have no effect on me.”&#10;&#10;“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my&#10;nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal&#10;side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,&#10;honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on&#10;both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of&#10;every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?&#10;The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,&#10;or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you&#10;were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in&#10;which you have been brought up.”&#10;&#10;“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that&#10;sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are&#10;equal.”&#10;&#10;“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother?&#10;Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their&#10;condition.”&#10;&#10;“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does&#10;not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”&#10;&#10;“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”&#10;&#10;Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady&#10;Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a&#10;moment’s deliberation:&#10;&#10;“I am not.”&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine seemed pleased.&#10;&#10;“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”&#10;&#10;“I will make no promise of the kind.”&#10;&#10;“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more&#10;reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that&#10;I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the&#10;assurance I require.”&#10;&#10;“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into&#10;anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry&#10;your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their&#10;marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would&#10;my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?&#10;Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have&#10;supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the&#10;application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if&#10;you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your&#10;nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;&#10;but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,&#10;therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”&#10;&#10;“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the&#10;objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am&#10;no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous&#10;elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a&#10;patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is&#10;such a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his&#10;late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are&#10;you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”&#10;&#10;“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.&#10;“You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to&#10;the house.”&#10;&#10;And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned&#10;back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.&#10;&#10;“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!&#10;Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you&#10;must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”&#10;&#10;“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”&#10;&#10;“You are then resolved to have him?”&#10;&#10;“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,&#10;which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without&#10;reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”&#10;&#10;“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the&#10;claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in&#10;the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”&#10;&#10;“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any&#10;possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either&#10;would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the&#10;resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former&#10;_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s&#10;concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in&#10;the scorn.”&#10;&#10;“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.&#10;I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your&#10;ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you&#10;reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”&#10;&#10;In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of&#10;the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave&#10;of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve&#10;no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her&#10;ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She&#10;heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother&#10;impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady&#10;Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.&#10;&#10;“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”&#10;&#10;“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously&#10;civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were&#10;well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through&#10;Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had&#10;nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to&#10;acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 57&#10;&#10;&#10;The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw&#10;Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many&#10;hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it&#10;appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,&#10;for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.&#10;Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report&#10;of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;&#10;till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,&#10;and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the&#10;expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply&#10;the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her&#10;sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours&#10;at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the&#10;Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had&#10;only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked&#10;forward to as possible at some future time.&#10;&#10;In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help&#10;feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting&#10;in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to&#10;prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate&#10;an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar&#10;representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared&#10;not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his&#10;aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose&#10;that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it&#10;was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,&#10;whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would&#10;address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would&#10;probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak&#10;and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.&#10;&#10;If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often&#10;seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might&#10;settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity&#10;unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady&#10;Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to&#10;Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.&#10;&#10;“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his&#10;friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand&#10;it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his&#10;constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might&#10;have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him&#10;at all.”&#10;&#10;                          * * * * *&#10;&#10;The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had&#10;been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same&#10;kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and&#10;Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.&#10;&#10;The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her&#10;father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.&#10;&#10;“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”&#10;&#10;She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to&#10;tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner&#10;connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it&#10;might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the&#10;consequent explanations.&#10;&#10;She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He&#10;then said,&#10;&#10;“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me&#10;exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its&#10;contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink&#10;of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”&#10;&#10;The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous&#10;conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;&#10;and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained&#10;himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to&#10;herself; when her father continued:&#10;&#10;“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters&#10;as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the&#10;name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”&#10;&#10;“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”&#10;&#10;“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with&#10;congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of&#10;which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping&#10;Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says&#10;on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus&#10;offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on&#10;this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;&#10;of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter&#10;Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after&#10;her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may&#10;be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in&#10;this land.’&#10;&#10;“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young&#10;gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of&#10;mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive&#10;patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin&#10;Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate&#10;closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be&#10;inclined to take immediate advantage of.’&#10;&#10;“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:&#10;&#10;“‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine&#10;that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with&#10;a friendly eye.’&#10;&#10;“_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_&#10;surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within&#10;the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie&#10;more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any&#10;woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his&#10;life! It is admirable!”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force&#10;one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so&#10;little agreeable to her.&#10;&#10;“Are you not diverted?”&#10;&#10;“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”&#10;&#10;“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last&#10;night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she&#10;felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some&#10;family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her&#10;consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty&#10;to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and&#10;her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run&#10;hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.&#10;Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad&#10;business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their&#10;living together before the marriage took place should be so generally&#10;known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain&#10;from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young&#10;couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an&#10;encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should&#10;very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,&#10;as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their&#10;names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ That is his notion of Christian&#10;forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte’s&#10;situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you&#10;look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,&#10;I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we&#10;live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our&#10;turn?”&#10;&#10;“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so&#10;strange!”&#10;&#10;“Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man&#10;it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_&#10;pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate&#10;writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any&#10;consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving&#10;him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and&#10;hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine&#10;about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”&#10;&#10;To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had&#10;been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by&#10;his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her&#10;feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she&#10;would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by&#10;what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference, and she could do nothing but&#10;wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of&#10;his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 58&#10;&#10;&#10;Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as&#10;Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy&#10;with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s&#10;visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time&#10;to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat&#10;in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed&#10;their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the&#10;habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five&#10;set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others&#10;to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy&#10;were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty&#10;was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a&#10;desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.&#10;&#10;They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon&#10;Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,&#10;when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the&#10;moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was&#10;high, she immediately said:&#10;&#10;“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving&#10;relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I&#10;can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my&#10;poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to&#10;acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest&#10;of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”&#10;&#10;“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise&#10;and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a&#10;mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner&#10;was so little to be trusted.”&#10;&#10;“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to&#10;me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could&#10;not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,&#10;in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced&#10;you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the&#10;sake of discovering them.”&#10;&#10;“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.&#10;That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other&#10;inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your&#10;_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought&#10;only of _you_.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,&#10;her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your&#10;feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_&#10;affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence&#10;me on this subject for ever.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of&#10;his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not&#10;very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone&#10;so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make&#10;her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The&#10;happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never&#10;felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as&#10;warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth&#10;been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the&#10;expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;&#10;but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of&#10;feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his&#10;affection every moment more valuable.&#10;&#10;They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to&#10;be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She&#10;soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding&#10;to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through&#10;London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the&#10;substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on&#10;every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,&#10;peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that&#10;such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise&#10;from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her&#10;ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.&#10;&#10;“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself&#10;to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,&#10;had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have&#10;acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough&#10;of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so&#10;abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all&#10;your relations.”&#10;&#10;“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your&#10;accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my&#10;behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was&#10;unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”&#10;&#10;“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that&#10;evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,&#10;will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved&#10;in civility.”&#10;&#10;“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I&#10;then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of&#10;it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your&#10;reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a&#10;more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can&#10;scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,&#10;I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”&#10;&#10;“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an&#10;impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such&#10;a way.”&#10;&#10;“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper&#10;feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never&#10;forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible&#10;way that would induce you to accept me.”&#10;&#10;“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at&#10;all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”&#10;&#10;Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you&#10;think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its&#10;contents?”&#10;&#10;She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her&#10;former prejudices had been removed.&#10;&#10;“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was&#10;necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part&#10;especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the&#10;power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might&#10;justly make you hate me.”&#10;&#10;“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the&#10;preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my&#10;opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily&#10;changed as that implies.”&#10;&#10;“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly&#10;calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a&#10;dreadful bitterness of spirit.”&#10;&#10;“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The&#10;adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings&#10;of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now&#10;so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant&#10;circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some&#10;of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you&#10;pleasure.”&#10;&#10;“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your&#10;retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment&#10;arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of&#10;innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude&#10;which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish&#10;being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I&#10;was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I&#10;was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.&#10;Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt&#10;by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all&#10;that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught&#10;me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family&#10;circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least&#10;to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I&#10;was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been&#10;but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You&#10;taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,&#10;I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.&#10;You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman&#10;worthy of being pleased.”&#10;&#10;“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”&#10;&#10;“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be&#10;wishing, expecting my addresses.”&#10;&#10;“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure&#10;you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me&#10;wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?”&#10;&#10;“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take&#10;a proper direction.”&#10;&#10;“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at&#10;Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”&#10;&#10;“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”&#10;&#10;“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.&#10;My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I&#10;confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”&#10;&#10;“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in&#10;my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to&#10;obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you&#10;see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes&#10;introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an&#10;hour after I had seen you.”&#10;&#10;He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her&#10;disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to&#10;the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of&#10;following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed&#10;before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness&#10;there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must&#10;comprehend.&#10;&#10;She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to&#10;each, to be dwelt on farther.&#10;&#10;After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know&#10;anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that&#10;it was time to be at home.&#10;&#10;“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which&#10;introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with&#10;their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of&#10;it.&#10;&#10;“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”&#10;&#10;“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And&#10;though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much&#10;the case.&#10;&#10;“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a&#10;confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I&#10;told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his&#10;affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had&#10;the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself&#10;mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent&#10;to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was&#10;unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his&#10;friend.&#10;&#10;“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him&#10;that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”&#10;&#10;“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits&#10;which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”&#10;&#10;“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to&#10;him.”&#10;&#10;“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had&#10;prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but&#10;his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess&#10;one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not&#10;allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months&#10;last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was&#10;angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained&#10;in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me&#10;now.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful&#10;friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked&#10;herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,&#10;and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness&#10;of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he&#10;continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they&#10;parted.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 59&#10;&#10;&#10;“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question&#10;which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,&#10;and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to&#10;say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own&#10;knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything&#10;else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.&#10;&#10;The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The&#10;acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.&#10;Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;&#10;and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy&#10;than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,&#10;there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt&#10;in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no&#10;one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a&#10;dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.&#10;&#10;At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far&#10;from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.&#10;&#10;“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,&#10;you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”&#10;&#10;“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and&#10;I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am&#10;in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are&#10;engaged.”&#10;&#10;Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much&#10;you dislike him.”&#10;&#10;“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I&#10;did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as&#10;these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever&#10;remember it myself.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more&#10;seriously assured her of its truth.&#10;&#10;“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried&#10;Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you&#10;certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be&#10;happy with him?”&#10;&#10;“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that&#10;we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,&#10;Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”&#10;&#10;“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more&#10;delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you&#10;really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than&#10;marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought&#10;to do?”&#10;&#10;“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I&#10;tell you all.”&#10;&#10;“What do you mean?”&#10;&#10;“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am&#10;afraid you will be angry.”&#10;&#10;“My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let&#10;me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me&#10;how long you have loved him?”&#10;&#10;“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.&#10;But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds&#10;at Pemberley.”&#10;&#10;Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the&#10;desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances&#10;of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing&#10;further to wish.&#10;&#10;“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.&#10;I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,&#10;I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your&#10;husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But&#10;Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you&#10;tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know&#10;of it to another, not to you.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling&#10;to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made&#10;her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer&#10;conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,&#10;and half the night spent in conversation.&#10;&#10;                          * * * * *&#10;&#10;“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next&#10;morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with&#10;our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always&#10;coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or&#10;other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?&#10;Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s&#10;way.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet&#10;was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an&#10;epithet.&#10;&#10;As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and&#10;shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;&#10;and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes&#10;hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”&#10;&#10;“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk&#10;to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has&#10;never seen the view.”&#10;&#10;“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am&#10;sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that&#10;she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see&#10;the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went&#10;up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:&#10;&#10;“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that&#10;disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is&#10;all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking&#10;to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to&#10;inconvenience.”&#10;&#10;During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be&#10;asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the&#10;application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother&#10;would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur&#10;would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she&#10;were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it&#10;was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit&#10;to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear&#10;the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her&#10;disapprobation.&#10;&#10;                          * * * * *&#10;&#10;In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw&#10;Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was&#10;extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to&#10;be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,&#10;his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be&#10;filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched&#10;reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,&#10;looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes&#10;he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while&#10;pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he&#10;wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.&#10;&#10;Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.&#10;“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be&#10;accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”&#10;&#10;How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more&#10;reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from&#10;explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;&#10;but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,&#10;of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.&#10;&#10;“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be&#10;sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.&#10;But will they make you happy?”&#10;&#10;“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my&#10;indifference?”&#10;&#10;“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but&#10;this would be nothing if you really liked him.”&#10;&#10;“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.&#10;Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not&#10;know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in&#10;such terms.”&#10;&#10;“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind&#10;of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he&#10;condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on&#10;having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know&#10;your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor&#10;respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked&#10;up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the&#10;greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape&#10;discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing&#10;_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are&#10;about.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and&#10;at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object&#10;of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of&#10;him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection&#10;was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months’&#10;suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did&#10;conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.&#10;&#10;“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to&#10;say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with&#10;you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”&#10;&#10;To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy&#10;had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.&#10;&#10;“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;&#10;made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him&#10;his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble&#10;and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have&#10;paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own&#10;way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about&#10;his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”&#10;&#10;He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading&#10;Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her&#10;at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come&#10;for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after&#10;half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join&#10;the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for&#10;gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer&#10;anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity&#10;would come in time.&#10;&#10;When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,&#10;and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;&#10;for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to&#10;utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could&#10;comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit&#10;what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a&#10;lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in&#10;her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.&#10;&#10;“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would&#10;have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich&#10;and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages&#10;you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so&#10;pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my&#10;dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I&#10;hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing&#10;that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,&#10;Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”&#10;&#10;This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and&#10;Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,&#10;soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,&#10;her mother followed her.&#10;&#10;“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten&#10;thousand a year, and very likely more! ‘Tis as good as a Lord! And a&#10;special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But&#10;my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,&#10;that I may have it to-morrow.”&#10;&#10;This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman&#10;himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain&#10;possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’&#10;consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow&#10;passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood&#10;in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to&#10;him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her&#10;deference for his opinion.&#10;&#10;Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get&#10;acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising&#10;every hour in his esteem.&#10;&#10;“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,&#10;is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well&#10;as Jane’s.”&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 60&#10;&#10;&#10;Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.&#10;Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could&#10;you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when&#10;you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first&#10;place?”&#10;&#10;“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which&#10;laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I&#10;knew that I _had_ begun.”&#10;&#10;“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour&#10;to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke&#10;to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;&#10;did you admire me for my impertinence?”&#10;&#10;“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”&#10;&#10;“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.&#10;The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious&#10;attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,&#10;and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and&#10;interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really&#10;amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you&#10;took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and&#10;in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously&#10;courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for&#10;it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly&#10;reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks&#10;of _that_ when they fall in love.”&#10;&#10;“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was&#10;ill at Netherfield?”&#10;&#10;“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it&#10;by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are&#10;to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me&#10;to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may&#10;be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling&#10;to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first&#10;called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did&#10;you look as if you did not care about me?”&#10;&#10;“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”&#10;&#10;“But I was embarrassed.”&#10;&#10;“And so was I.”&#10;&#10;“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”&#10;&#10;“A man who had felt less, might.”&#10;&#10;“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that&#10;I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you&#10;_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when&#10;you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of&#10;thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.&#10;_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort&#10;springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the&#10;subject. This will never do.”&#10;&#10;“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady&#10;Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of&#10;removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to&#10;your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour&#10;to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me&#10;hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.”&#10;&#10;“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,&#10;for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to&#10;Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?&#10;or had you intended any more serious consequence?”&#10;&#10;“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I&#10;might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to&#10;myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,&#10;and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”&#10;&#10;“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to&#10;befall her?”&#10;&#10;“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it&#10;ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be&#10;done directly.”&#10;&#10;“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and&#10;admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But&#10;I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”&#10;&#10;From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy&#10;had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s&#10;long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would&#10;be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and&#10;aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as&#10;follows:&#10;&#10;“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,&#10;for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the&#10;truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.&#10;But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your&#10;fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the&#10;subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you&#10;cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a&#10;great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,&#10;for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your&#10;idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I&#10;am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so&#10;before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she&#10;only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that&#10;he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.&#10;Yours, etc.”&#10;&#10;Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still&#10;different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply&#10;to his last.&#10;&#10;“DEAR SIR,&#10;&#10;“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon&#10;be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.&#10;But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.&#10;&#10;“Yours sincerely, etc.”&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching&#10;marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even&#10;to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her&#10;former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was&#10;affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing&#10;her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.&#10;&#10;The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,&#10;was as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were&#10;insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of&#10;being loved by her sister.&#10;&#10;Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations&#10;to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the&#10;Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this&#10;sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered&#10;so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that&#10;Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till&#10;the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend&#10;was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their&#10;meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she&#10;saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of&#10;her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even&#10;listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away&#10;the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all&#10;meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did&#10;shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his&#10;forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in&#10;too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good&#10;humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.&#10;Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all&#10;likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield&#10;him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep&#10;him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse&#10;without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising&#10;from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it&#10;added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to&#10;the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing&#10;to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at&#10;Pemberley.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Chapter 61&#10;&#10;&#10;Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got&#10;rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride&#10;she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may&#10;be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the&#10;accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many&#10;of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,&#10;amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it&#10;was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity&#10;in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and&#10;invariably silly.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her&#10;drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in&#10;going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near&#10;a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to&#10;_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his&#10;sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county&#10;to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source&#10;of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.&#10;&#10;Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with&#10;her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally&#10;known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a&#10;temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example,&#10;she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less&#10;ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s&#10;society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham&#10;frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of&#10;balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.&#10;&#10;Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily&#10;drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite&#10;unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but&#10;she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no&#10;longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,&#10;it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without&#10;much reluctance.&#10;&#10;As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from&#10;the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that&#10;Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude&#10;and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every&#10;thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on&#10;to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received&#10;from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,&#10;if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this&#10;effect:&#10;&#10;“MY DEAR LIZZY,&#10;&#10;“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear&#10;Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so&#10;rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.&#10;I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not&#10;think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.&#10;Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,&#10;do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.&#10;&#10;“Yours, etc.”&#10;&#10;As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in&#10;her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.&#10;Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice&#10;of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she&#10;frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an&#10;income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in&#10;their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to&#10;their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or&#10;herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance&#10;towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the&#10;restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the&#10;extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap&#10;situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for&#10;her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and&#10;in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to&#10;reputation which her marriage had given her.&#10;&#10;Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for&#10;Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was&#10;occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself&#10;in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently&#10;staid so long, that even Bingley’s good humour was overcome, and he&#10;proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.&#10;&#10;Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she&#10;thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she&#10;dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as&#10;attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility&#10;to Elizabeth.&#10;&#10;Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters&#10;was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each&#10;other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion&#10;in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with&#10;an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of&#10;talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect&#10;which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open&#10;pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen&#10;in her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to comprehend that&#10;a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not&#10;always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.&#10;&#10;Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;&#10;and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in&#10;her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him&#10;language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time&#10;all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,&#10;he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;&#10;and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her&#10;resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity&#10;to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait&#10;on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had&#10;received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the&#10;visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.&#10;&#10;With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.&#10;Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever&#10;sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing&#10;her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen&#10;&#10;*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***&#10;&#10;***** This file should be named 1342-0.txt or 1342-0.zip *****&#10;This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:&#10;        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/4/1342/&#10;&#10;Produced by Anonymous Volunteers&#10;&#10;Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions&#10;will be renamed.&#10;&#10;Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no&#10;one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation&#10;(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without&#10;permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of&#10;electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers&#10;including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists&#10;because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from&#10;people in all walks of life.&#10;&#10;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#10;assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s&#10;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will&#10;remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#10;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.&#10;To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&#10;and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4&#10;and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#10;Literary Archive Foundation&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide&#10;spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#10;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#10;freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest&#10;array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations&#10;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#10;status with the IRS.&#10;&#10;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#10;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#10;States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#10;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#10;with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations&#10;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To&#10;SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any&#10;particular state visit http://pglaf.org&#10;&#10;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#10;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#10;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#10;approach us with offers to donate.&#10;&#10;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#10;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#10;outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#10;&#10;Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation&#10;methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other&#10;ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.&#10;To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic&#10;works.&#10;&#10;Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared&#10;with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project&#10;Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.&#10;&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed&#10;editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.&#10;unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily&#10;keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.&#10;&#10;&#10;Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:&#10;&#10;     http://www.gutenberg.org&#10;&#10;This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,&#10;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#10;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to&#10;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.&#10;"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 65 69 73 77 81 85 89 93
