Down the Rabbit-Hole&#10;&#10;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the&#10;bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the&#10;book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in&#10;it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or&#10;conversations?’&#10;&#10;So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the&#10;hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure&#10;of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and&#10;picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran&#10;close by her.&#10;&#10;There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so&#10;VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear!&#10;Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it&#10;occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time&#10;it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH&#10;OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,&#10;Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had&#10;never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch&#10;to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field&#10;after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large&#10;rabbit-hole under the hedge.&#10;&#10;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how&#10;in the world she was to get out again.&#10;&#10;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then&#10;dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think&#10;about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep&#10;well.&#10;&#10;Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had&#10;plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was&#10;going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what&#10;she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she&#10;looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with&#10;cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures&#10;hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as&#10;she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great&#10;disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear&#10;of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as&#10;she fell past it.&#10;&#10;‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall&#10;think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at&#10;home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top&#10;of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)&#10;&#10;Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! ‘I wonder how&#10;many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting&#10;somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four&#10;thousand miles down, I think--’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several&#10;things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this&#10;was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there&#10;was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)&#10;‘--yes, that’s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude&#10;or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or&#10;Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)&#10;&#10;Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the&#10;earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with&#10;their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--’ (she was rather glad&#10;there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the&#10;right word) ‘--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country&#10;is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and&#10;she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you’re falling&#10;through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an&#10;ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to&#10;ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’&#10;&#10;Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began&#10;talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’&#10;(Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at&#10;tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no&#10;mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very&#10;like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice&#10;began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy&#10;sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do&#10;bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question,&#10;it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing&#10;off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with&#10;Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:&#10;did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon&#10;a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.&#10;&#10;Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:&#10;she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another&#10;long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.&#10;There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and&#10;was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears&#10;and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she&#10;turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found&#10;herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging&#10;from the roof.&#10;&#10;There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when&#10;Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every&#10;door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to&#10;get out again.&#10;&#10;Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid&#10;glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s&#10;first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;&#10;but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,&#10;but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second&#10;time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and&#10;behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the&#10;little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!&#10;&#10;Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not&#10;much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage&#10;into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of&#10;that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and&#10;those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the&#10;doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it&#10;would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could&#10;shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.’&#10;For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,&#10;that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really&#10;impossible.&#10;&#10;There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went&#10;back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at&#10;any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this&#10;time she found a little bottle on it, [‘which certainly was not here&#10;before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper&#10;label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large&#10;letters.&#10;&#10;It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was&#10;not going to do THAT in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and&#10;see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice&#10;little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild&#10;beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember&#10;the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot&#10;poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your&#10;finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never&#10;forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is&#10;almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.&#10;&#10;However, this bottle was NOT marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste&#10;it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour&#10;of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot&#10;buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.&#10;&#10;  *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;  *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a&#10;telescope.’&#10;&#10;And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face&#10;brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going&#10;through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she&#10;waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:&#10;she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said&#10;Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder&#10;what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a&#10;candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember&#10;ever having seen such a thing.&#10;&#10;After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going&#10;into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the&#10;door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she&#10;went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach&#10;it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her&#10;best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;&#10;and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing&#10;sat down and cried.&#10;&#10;‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself,&#10;rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally&#10;gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),&#10;and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into&#10;her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having&#10;cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,&#10;for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.&#10;‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people!&#10;Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!’&#10;&#10;Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:&#10;she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words&#10;‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said&#10;Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it&#10;makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll&#10;get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’&#10;&#10;She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which&#10;way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was&#10;growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same&#10;size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice&#10;had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way&#10;things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on&#10;in the common way.&#10;&#10;So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.&#10;&#10;  *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;  *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears&#10;&#10;‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that&#10;for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m&#10;opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’&#10;(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of&#10;sight, they were getting so far off). ‘Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder&#10;who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure&#10;_I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble&#10;myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be&#10;kind to them,’ thought Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want&#10;to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.’&#10;&#10;And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. ‘They must&#10;go by the carrier,’ she thought; ‘and how funny it’ll seem, sending&#10;presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!&#10;&#10;     ALICE’S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.&#10;       HEARTHRUG,&#10;         NEAR THE FENDER,&#10;           (WITH ALICE’S LOVE).&#10;&#10;Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!’&#10;&#10;Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was&#10;now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden&#10;key and hurried off to the garden door.&#10;&#10;Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to&#10;look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more&#10;hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.&#10;&#10;‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ said Alice, ‘a great girl like&#10;you,’ (she might well say this), ‘to go on crying in this way! Stop this&#10;moment, I tell you!’ But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of&#10;tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches&#10;deep and reaching half down the hall.&#10;&#10;After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and&#10;she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White&#10;Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in&#10;one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great&#10;hurry, muttering to himself as he came, ‘Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!&#10;Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!’ Alice felt so&#10;desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit&#10;came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, ‘If you please, sir--’&#10;The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,&#10;and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.&#10;&#10;Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she&#10;kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: ‘Dear, dear! How&#10;queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.&#10;I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the&#10;same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a&#10;little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who&#10;in the world am I? Ah, THAT’S the great puzzle!’ And she began thinking&#10;over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to&#10;see if she could have been changed for any of them.&#10;&#10;‘I’m sure I’m not Ada,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes in such long&#10;ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t&#10;be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a&#10;very little! Besides, SHE’S she, and I’m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling&#10;it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me&#10;see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and&#10;four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!&#10;However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography.&#10;London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and&#10;Rome--no, THAT’S all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for&#10;Mabel! I’ll try and say “How doth the little--“’ and she crossed her&#10;hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,&#10;but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the&#10;same as they used to do:--&#10;&#10;     ‘How doth the little crocodile&#10;      Improve his shining tail,&#10;     And pour the waters of the Nile&#10;      On every golden scale!&#10;&#10;     ‘How cheerfully he seems to grin,&#10;      How neatly spread his claws,&#10;     And welcome little fishes in&#10;      With gently smiling jaws!’&#10;&#10;‘I’m sure those are not the right words,’ said poor Alice, and her eyes&#10;filled with tears again as she went on, ‘I must be Mabel after all, and&#10;I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to&#10;no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve&#10;made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no&#10;use their putting their heads down and saying “Come up again, dear!” I&#10;shall only look up and say “Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,&#10;if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here&#10;till I’m somebody else”--but, oh dear!’ cried Alice, with a sudden burst&#10;of tears, ‘I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired&#10;of being all alone here!’&#10;&#10;As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see&#10;that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while&#10;she was talking. ‘How CAN I have done that?’ she thought. ‘I must&#10;be growing small again.’ She got up and went to the table to measure&#10;herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now&#10;about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found&#10;out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped&#10;it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.&#10;&#10;‘That WAS a narrow escape!’ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the&#10;sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; ‘and&#10;now for the garden!’ and she ran with all speed back to the little door:&#10;but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was&#10;lying on the glass table as before, ‘and things are worse than ever,’&#10;thought the poor child, ‘for I never was so small as this before, never!&#10;And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!’&#10;&#10;As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!&#10;she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she&#10;had somehow fallen into the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by&#10;railway,’ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in&#10;her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go&#10;to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the&#10;sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row&#10;of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon&#10;made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she&#10;was nine feet high.&#10;&#10;‘I wish I hadn’t cried so much!’ said Alice, as she swam about, trying&#10;to find her way out. ‘I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by&#10;being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!&#10;However, everything is queer to-day.’&#10;&#10;Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way&#10;off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought&#10;it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small&#10;she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had&#10;slipped in like herself.&#10;&#10;‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse?&#10;Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very&#10;likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.’ So she&#10;began: ‘O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired&#10;of swimming about here, O Mouse!’ (Alice thought this must be the right&#10;way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but&#10;she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, ‘A mouse--of&#10;a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!’) The Mouse looked at her rather&#10;inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,&#10;but it said nothing.&#10;&#10;‘Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,’ thought Alice; ‘I daresay it’s&#10;a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.’ (For, with all&#10;her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago&#10;anything had happened.) So she began again: ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ which&#10;was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a&#10;sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.&#10;‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt&#10;the poor animal’s feelings. ‘I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.’&#10;&#10;‘Not like cats!’ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. ‘Would&#10;YOU like cats if you were me?’&#10;&#10;‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Alice in a soothing tone: ‘don’t be angry&#10;about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d&#10;take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet&#10;thing,’ Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the&#10;pool, ‘and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and&#10;washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she’s&#10;such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried&#10;Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she&#10;felt certain it must be really offended. ‘We won’t talk about her any&#10;more if you’d rather not.’&#10;&#10;‘We indeed!’ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his&#10;tail. ‘As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED&#10;cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!’&#10;&#10;‘I won’t indeed!’ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of&#10;conversation. ‘Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?’ The Mouse did not&#10;answer, so Alice went on eagerly: ‘There is such a nice little dog near&#10;our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you&#10;know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when&#10;you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts&#10;of things--I can’t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,&#10;you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He&#10;says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!’ cried Alice in a sorrowful&#10;tone, ‘I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!’ For the Mouse was swimming&#10;away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in&#10;the pool as it went.&#10;&#10;So she called softly after it, ‘Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we&#10;won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!’ When the&#10;Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its&#10;face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low&#10;trembling voice, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my&#10;history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.’&#10;&#10;It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the&#10;birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,&#10;a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the&#10;way, and the whole party swam to the shore.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale&#10;&#10;They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the&#10;birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close&#10;to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.&#10;&#10;The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a&#10;consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural&#10;to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had&#10;known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the&#10;Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, ‘I am older than&#10;you, and must know better’; and this Alice would not allow without&#10;knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its&#10;age, there was no more to be said.&#10;&#10;At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,&#10;called out, ‘Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’LL soon make you&#10;dry enough!’ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse&#10;in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt&#10;sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.&#10;&#10;‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready? This&#10;is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! “William&#10;the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted&#10;to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much&#10;accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of&#10;Mercia and Northumbria--“’&#10;&#10;‘Ugh!’ said the Lory, with a shiver.&#10;&#10;‘I beg your pardon!’ said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: ‘Did&#10;you speak?’&#10;&#10;‘Not I!’ said the Lory hastily.&#10;&#10;‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse. ‘--I proceed. “Edwin and Morcar,&#10;the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,&#10;the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--“’&#10;&#10;‘Found WHAT?’ said the Duck.&#10;&#10;‘Found IT,’ the Mouse replied rather crossly: ‘of course you know what&#10;“it” means.’&#10;&#10;‘I know what “it” means well enough, when I find a thing,’ said the&#10;Duck: ‘it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the&#10;archbishop find?’&#10;&#10;The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ‘“--found&#10;it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the&#10;crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his&#10;Normans--” How are you getting on now, my dear?’ it continued, turning&#10;to Alice as it spoke.&#10;&#10;‘As wet as ever,’ said Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to&#10;dry me at all.’&#10;&#10;‘In that case,’ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, ‘I move&#10;that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic&#10;remedies--’&#10;&#10;‘Speak English!’ said the Eaglet. ‘I don’t know the meaning of half&#10;those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!’ And&#10;the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds&#10;tittered audibly.&#10;&#10;‘What I was going to say,’ said the Dodo in an offended tone, ‘was, that&#10;the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.’&#10;&#10;‘What IS a Caucus-race?’ said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,&#10;but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,&#10;and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.&#10;&#10;‘Why,’ said the Dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is to do it.’ (And, as&#10;you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell&#10;you how the Dodo managed it.)&#10;&#10;First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, [‘the exact&#10;shape doesn’t matter,’ it said,) and then all the party were placed&#10;along the course, here and there. There was no ‘One, two, three, and&#10;away,’ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they&#10;liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,&#10;when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,&#10;the Dodo suddenly called out ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded&#10;round it, panting, and asking, ‘But who has won?’&#10;&#10;This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,&#10;and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead&#10;(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures&#10;of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,&#10;‘EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.’&#10;&#10;‘But who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of voices asked.&#10;&#10;‘Why, SHE, of course,’ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;&#10;and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused&#10;way, ‘Prizes! Prizes!’&#10;&#10;Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her&#10;pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had&#10;not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one&#10;a-piece all round.&#10;&#10;‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.&#10;&#10;‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely. ‘What else have you got in&#10;your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.&#10;&#10;‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.&#10;&#10;Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly&#10;presented the thimble, saying ‘We beg your acceptance of this elegant&#10;thimble’; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.&#10;&#10;Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave&#10;that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything&#10;to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she&#10;could.&#10;&#10;The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and&#10;confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste&#10;theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.&#10;However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and&#10;begged the Mouse to tell them something more.&#10;&#10;‘You promised to tell me your history, you know,’ said Alice, ‘and why&#10;it is you hate--C and D,’ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it&#10;would be offended again.&#10;&#10;‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and&#10;sighing.&#10;&#10;‘It IS a long tail, certainly,’ said Alice, looking down with wonder at&#10;the Mouse’s tail; ‘but why do you call it sad?’ And she kept on puzzling&#10;about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was&#10;something like this:--&#10;&#10;         ‘Fury said to a&#10;         mouse, That he&#10;        met in the&#10;       house,&#10;     “Let us&#10;      both go to&#10;       law: I will&#10;        prosecute&#10;         YOU.--Come,&#10;           I’ll take no&#10;           denial; We&#10;          must have a&#10;        trial: For&#10;      really this&#10;     morning I’ve&#10;    nothing&#10;    to do.”&#10;      Said the&#10;      mouse to the&#10;       cur, “Such&#10;        a trial,&#10;         dear Sir,&#10;            With&#10;          no jury&#10;        or judge,&#10;       would be&#10;      wasting&#10;      our&#10;      breath.”&#10;        “I’ll be&#10;        judge, I’ll&#10;         be jury,”&#10;             Said&#10;         cunning&#10;          old Fury:&#10;          “I’ll&#10;          try the&#10;            whole&#10;            cause,&#10;              and&#10;           condemn&#10;           you&#10;          to&#10;           death.”’&#10;&#10;&#10;‘You are not attending!’ said the Mouse to Alice severely. ‘What are you&#10;thinking of?’&#10;&#10;‘I beg your pardon,’ said Alice very humbly: ‘you had got to the fifth&#10;bend, I think?’&#10;&#10;‘I had NOT!’ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.&#10;&#10;‘A knot!’ said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking&#10;anxiously about her. ‘Oh, do let me help to undo it!’&#10;&#10;‘I shall do nothing of the sort,’ said the Mouse, getting up and walking&#10;away. ‘You insult me by talking such nonsense!’&#10;&#10;‘I didn’t mean it!’ pleaded poor Alice. ‘But you’re so easily offended,&#10;you know!’&#10;&#10;The Mouse only growled in reply.&#10;&#10;‘Please come back and finish your story!’ Alice called after it; and the&#10;others all joined in chorus, ‘Yes, please do!’ but the Mouse only shook&#10;its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.&#10;&#10;‘What a pity it wouldn’t stay!’ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite&#10;out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her&#10;daughter ‘Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose&#10;YOUR temper!’ ‘Hold your tongue, Ma!’ said the young Crab, a little&#10;snappishly. ‘You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!’&#10;&#10;‘I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!’ said Alice aloud, addressing&#10;nobody in particular. ‘She’d soon fetch it back!’&#10;&#10;‘And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?’ said the&#10;Lory.&#10;&#10;Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:&#10;‘Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you&#10;can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,&#10;she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!’&#10;&#10;This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the&#10;birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very&#10;carefully, remarking, ‘I really must be getting home; the night-air&#10;doesn’t suit my throat!’ and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to&#10;its children, ‘Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!’&#10;On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.&#10;&#10;‘I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!’ she said to herself in a melancholy&#10;tone. ‘Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best&#10;cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you&#10;any more!’ And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very&#10;lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard&#10;a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up&#10;eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming&#10;back to finish his story.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill&#10;&#10;It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking&#10;anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard&#10;it muttering to itself ‘The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh&#10;my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are&#10;ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?’ Alice guessed in a&#10;moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,&#10;and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were&#10;nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in&#10;the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,&#10;had vanished completely.&#10;&#10;Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and&#10;called out to her in an angry tone, ‘Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing&#10;out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!&#10;Quick, now!’ And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once&#10;in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it&#10;had made.&#10;&#10;‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself as she ran. ‘How&#10;surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him&#10;his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.’ As she said this, she&#10;came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass&#10;plate with the name ‘W. RABBIT’ engraved upon it. She went in without&#10;knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the&#10;real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the&#10;fan and gloves.&#10;&#10;‘How queer it seems,’ Alice said to herself, ‘to be going messages for&#10;a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!’ And she&#10;began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ‘“Miss Alice! Come&#10;here directly, and get ready for your walk!” “Coming in a minute,&#10;nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.” Only I don’t&#10;think,’ Alice went on, ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it&#10;began ordering people about like that!’&#10;&#10;By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table&#10;in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs&#10;of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,&#10;and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little&#10;bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time&#10;with the words ‘DRINK ME,’ but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it&#10;to her lips. ‘I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,’ she said&#10;to herself, ‘whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what&#10;this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really&#10;I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!’&#10;&#10;It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had&#10;drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,&#10;and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put&#10;down the bottle, saying to herself ‘That’s quite enough--I hope I shan’t&#10;grow any more--As it is, I can’t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn’t&#10;drunk quite so much!’&#10;&#10;Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,&#10;and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there&#10;was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with&#10;one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.&#10;Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out&#10;of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself ‘Now I&#10;can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?’&#10;&#10;Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,&#10;and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there&#10;seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room&#10;again, no wonder she felt unhappy.&#10;&#10;‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t&#10;always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and&#10;rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and&#10;yet--it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what&#10;CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that&#10;kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!&#10;There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I&#10;grow up, I’ll write one--but I’m grown up now,’ she added in a sorrowful&#10;tone; ‘at least there’s no room to grow up any more HERE.’&#10;&#10;‘But then,’ thought Alice, ‘shall I NEVER get any older than I am&#10;now? That’ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but&#10;then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like THAT!’&#10;&#10;‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself. ‘How can you learn&#10;lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all&#10;for any lesson-books!’&#10;&#10;And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making&#10;quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard&#10;a voice outside, and stopped to listen.&#10;&#10;‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘Fetch me my gloves this moment!’&#10;Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was&#10;the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the&#10;house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large&#10;as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.&#10;&#10;Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as&#10;the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,&#10;that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself ‘Then I’ll&#10;go round and get in at the window.’&#10;&#10;‘THAT you won’t’ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied&#10;she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her&#10;hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,&#10;but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,&#10;from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a&#10;cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.&#10;&#10;Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit’s--‘Pat! Pat! Where are you?’ And&#10;then a voice she had never heard before, ‘Sure then I’m here! Digging&#10;for apples, yer honour!’&#10;&#10;‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily. ‘Here! Come and&#10;help me out of THIS!’ (Sounds of more broken glass.)&#10;&#10;‘Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?’&#10;&#10;‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced it ‘arrum.’)&#10;&#10;‘An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole&#10;window!’&#10;&#10;‘Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.’&#10;&#10;‘Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!’&#10;&#10;There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers&#10;now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at&#10;all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you coward!’ and at last she spread out her&#10;hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were&#10;TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘What a number of&#10;cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice. ‘I wonder what they’ll do&#10;next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I’m&#10;sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer!’&#10;&#10;She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a&#10;rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices&#10;all talking together: she made out the words: ‘Where’s the other&#10;ladder?--Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other--Bill!&#10;fetch it here, lad!--Here, put ‘em up at this corner--No, tie ‘em&#10;together first--they don’t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they’ll&#10;do well enough; don’t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this&#10;rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it’s coming&#10;down! Heads below!’ (a loud crash)--‘Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I&#10;fancy--Who’s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan’t! YOU do it!--That I&#10;won’t, then!--Bill’s to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you’re to&#10;go down the chimney!’&#10;&#10;‘Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?’ said Alice to&#10;herself. ‘Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in&#10;Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but&#10;I THINK I can kick a little!’&#10;&#10;She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited&#10;till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)&#10;scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,&#10;saying to herself ‘This is Bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and waited to&#10;see what would happen next.&#10;&#10;The first thing she heard was a general chorus of ‘There goes Bill!’&#10;then the Rabbit’s voice along--‘Catch him, you by the hedge!’ then&#10;silence, and then another confusion of voices--‘Hold up his head--Brandy&#10;now--Don’t choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell&#10;us all about it!’&#10;&#10;Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [‘That’s Bill,’ thought&#10;Alice,) ‘Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I’m better now--but I’m&#10;a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me&#10;like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!’&#10;&#10;‘So you did, old fellow!’ said the others.&#10;&#10;‘We must burn the house down!’ said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called&#10;out as loud as she could, ‘If you do. I’ll set Dinah at you!’&#10;&#10;There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, ‘I&#10;wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the&#10;roof off.’ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and&#10;Alice heard the Rabbit say, ‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’&#10;&#10;‘A barrowful of WHAT?’ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,&#10;for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the&#10;window, and some of them hit her in the face. ‘I’ll put a stop to this,’&#10;she said to herself, and shouted out, ‘You’d better not do that again!’&#10;which produced another dead silence.&#10;&#10;Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into&#10;little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her&#10;head. ‘If I eat one of these cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make&#10;SOME change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must&#10;make me smaller, I suppose.’&#10;&#10;So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she&#10;began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through&#10;the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little&#10;animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was&#10;in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it&#10;something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she&#10;appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself&#10;safe in a thick wood.&#10;&#10;‘The first thing I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to herself, as she wandered&#10;about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second&#10;thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be&#10;the best plan.’&#10;&#10;It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply&#10;arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea&#10;how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among&#10;the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a&#10;great hurry.&#10;&#10;An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and&#10;feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. ‘Poor little thing!’&#10;said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but&#10;she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be&#10;hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of&#10;all her coaxing.&#10;&#10;Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and&#10;held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off&#10;all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,&#10;and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,&#10;to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the&#10;other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head&#10;over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was&#10;very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every&#10;moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then&#10;the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very&#10;little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely&#10;all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with&#10;its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.&#10;&#10;This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she&#10;set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and&#10;till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.&#10;&#10;‘And yet what a dear little puppy it was!’ said Alice, as she leant&#10;against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the&#10;leaves: ‘I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I’d&#10;only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that&#10;I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I&#10;suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great&#10;question is, what?’&#10;&#10;The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at&#10;the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that&#10;looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.&#10;There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as&#10;herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and&#10;behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what&#10;was on the top of it.&#10;&#10;She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the&#10;mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,&#10;that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long&#10;hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar&#10;&#10;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:&#10;at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed&#10;her in a languid, sleepy voice.&#10;&#10;‘Who are YOU?’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,&#10;rather shyly, ‘I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know&#10;who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been&#10;changed several times since then.’&#10;&#10;‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar sternly. ‘Explain&#10;yourself!’&#10;&#10;‘I can’t explain MYSELF, I’m afraid, sir’ said Alice, ‘because I’m not&#10;myself, you see.’&#10;&#10;‘I don’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied very politely,&#10;‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many&#10;different sizes in a day is very confusing.’&#10;&#10;‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;‘Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said Alice; ‘but when you&#10;have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then&#10;after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little&#10;queer, won’t you?’&#10;&#10;‘Not a bit,’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;‘Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said Alice; ‘all I know&#10;is, it would feel very queer to ME.’&#10;&#10;‘You!’ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. ‘Who are YOU?’&#10;&#10;Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.&#10;Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such VERY&#10;short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, ‘I think,&#10;you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.’&#10;&#10;‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any&#10;good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant&#10;state of mind, she turned away.&#10;&#10;‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called after her. ‘I’ve something important&#10;to say!’&#10;&#10;This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.&#10;&#10;‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;‘Is that all?’ said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she&#10;could.&#10;&#10;‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and&#10;perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some&#10;minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its&#10;arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘So you think&#10;you’re changed, do you?’&#10;&#10;‘I’m afraid I am, sir,’ said Alice; ‘I can’t remember things as I&#10;used--and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!’&#10;&#10;‘Can’t remember WHAT things?’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;‘Well, I’ve tried to say “HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,” but it all came&#10;different!’ Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.&#10;&#10;‘Repeat, “YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,”’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;Alice folded her hands, and began:--&#10;&#10;   ‘You are old, Father William,’ the young man said,&#10;    ‘And your hair has become very white;&#10;   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--&#10;    Do you think, at your age, it is right?’&#10;&#10;   ‘In my youth,’ Father William replied to his son,&#10;    ‘I feared it might injure the brain;&#10;   But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,&#10;    Why, I do it again and again.’&#10;&#10;   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘as I mentioned before,&#10;    And have grown most uncommonly fat;&#10;   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--&#10;    Pray, what is the reason of that?’&#10;&#10;   ‘In my youth,’ said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,&#10;    ‘I kept all my limbs very supple&#10;   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--&#10;    Allow me to sell you a couple?’&#10;&#10;   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘and your jaws are too weak&#10;    For anything tougher than suet;&#10;   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--&#10;    Pray how did you manage to do it?’&#10;&#10;   ‘In my youth,’ said his father, ‘I took to the law,&#10;    And argued each case with my wife;&#10;   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,&#10;    Has lasted the rest of my life.’&#10;&#10;   ‘You are old,’ said the youth, ‘one would hardly suppose&#10;    That your eye was as steady as ever;&#10;   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--&#10;    What made you so awfully clever?’&#10;&#10;   ‘I have answered three questions, and that is enough,’&#10;    Said his father; ‘don’t give yourself airs!&#10;   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?&#10;    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!’&#10;&#10;&#10;‘That is not said right,’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;‘Not QUITE right, I’m afraid,’ said Alice, timidly; ‘some of the words&#10;have got altered.’&#10;&#10;‘It is wrong from beginning to end,’ said the Caterpillar decidedly, and&#10;there was silence for some minutes.&#10;&#10;The Caterpillar was the first to speak.&#10;&#10;‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.&#10;&#10;‘Oh, I’m not particular as to size,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘only one&#10;doesn’t like changing so often, you know.’&#10;&#10;‘I DON’T know,’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life&#10;before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.&#10;&#10;‘Are you content now?’ said the Caterpillar.&#10;&#10;‘Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,’&#10;said Alice: ‘three inches is such a wretched height to be.’&#10;&#10;‘It is a very good height indeed!’ said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing&#10;itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).&#10;&#10;‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And&#10;she thought of herself, ‘I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily&#10;offended!’&#10;&#10;‘You’ll get used to it in time,’ said the Caterpillar; and it put the&#10;hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.&#10;&#10;This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In&#10;a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth&#10;and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the&#10;mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,&#10;‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you&#10;grow shorter.’&#10;&#10;‘One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?’ thought Alice to herself.&#10;&#10;‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it&#10;aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.&#10;&#10;Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying&#10;to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly&#10;round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she&#10;stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit&#10;of the edge with each hand.&#10;&#10;‘And now which is which?’ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of&#10;the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent&#10;blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!&#10;&#10;She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt&#10;that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she&#10;set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed&#10;so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her&#10;mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the&#10;lefthand bit.&#10;&#10;&#10;  *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;  *    *    *    *    *    *    *&#10;&#10;‘Come, my head’s free at last!’ said Alice in a tone of delight, which&#10;changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders&#10;were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was&#10;an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a&#10;sea of green leaves that lay far below her.&#10;&#10;‘What CAN all that green stuff be?’ said Alice. ‘And where HAVE my&#10;shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?’&#10;She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,&#10;except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.&#10;&#10;As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she&#10;tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her&#10;neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had&#10;just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going&#10;to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops&#10;of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made&#10;her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and&#10;was beating her violently with its wings.&#10;&#10;‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.&#10;&#10;‘I’m NOT a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. ‘Let me alone!’&#10;&#10;‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,&#10;and added with a kind of sob, ‘I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems&#10;to suit them!’&#10;&#10;‘I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried&#10;hedges,’ the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; ‘but those&#10;serpents! There’s no pleasing them!’&#10;&#10;Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in&#10;saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.&#10;&#10;‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,’ said the Pigeon;&#10;‘but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I&#10;haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!’&#10;&#10;‘I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,’ said Alice, who was beginning to&#10;see its meaning.&#10;&#10;‘And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,’ continued the&#10;Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, ‘and just as I was thinking I&#10;should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from&#10;the sky! Ugh, Serpent!’&#10;&#10;‘But I’m NOT a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice. ‘I’m a--I’m a--’&#10;&#10;‘Well! WHAT are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can see you’re trying to&#10;invent something!’&#10;&#10;‘I--I’m a little girl,’ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered&#10;the number of changes she had gone through that day.&#10;&#10;‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest&#10;contempt. ‘I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE&#10;with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use&#10;denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an&#10;egg!’&#10;&#10;‘I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,’ said Alice, who was a very truthful&#10;child; ‘but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you&#10;know.’&#10;&#10;‘I don’t believe it,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but if they do, why then they’re&#10;a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.’&#10;&#10;This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a&#10;minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, ‘You’re&#10;looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me&#10;whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?’&#10;&#10;‘It matters a good deal to ME,’ said Alice hastily; ‘but I’m not looking&#10;for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want YOURS: I don’t&#10;like them raw.’&#10;&#10;‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled&#10;down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as&#10;she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and&#10;every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she&#10;remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and&#10;she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the&#10;other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had&#10;succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.&#10;&#10;It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it&#10;felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,&#10;and began talking to herself, as usual. ‘Come, there’s half my plan done&#10;now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going&#10;to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right&#10;size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that&#10;to be done, I wonder?’ As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open&#10;place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ‘Whoever lives&#10;there,’ thought Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,&#10;I should frighten them out of their wits!’ So she began nibbling at the&#10;righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she&#10;had brought herself down to nine inches high.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper&#10;&#10;For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what&#10;to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the&#10;wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:&#10;otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a&#10;fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened&#10;by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a&#10;frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all&#10;over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,&#10;and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.&#10;&#10;The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,&#10;nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,&#10;saying, in a solemn tone, ‘For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen&#10;to play croquet.’ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,&#10;only changing the order of the words a little, ‘From the Queen. An&#10;invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.’&#10;&#10;Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.&#10;&#10;Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the&#10;wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the&#10;Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the&#10;door, staring stupidly up into the sky.&#10;&#10;Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.&#10;&#10;‘There’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the Footman, ‘and that for&#10;two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you&#10;are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could&#10;possibly hear you.’ And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise&#10;going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then&#10;a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.&#10;&#10;‘Please, then,’ said Alice, ‘how am I to get in?’&#10;&#10;‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ the Footman went on&#10;without attending to her, ‘if we had the door between us. For instance,&#10;if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.’&#10;He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this&#10;Alice thought decidedly uncivil. ‘But perhaps he can’t help it,’ she&#10;said to herself; ‘his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.&#10;But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?’ she&#10;repeated, aloud.&#10;&#10;‘I shall sit here,’ the Footman remarked, ‘till tomorrow--’&#10;&#10;At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came&#10;skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,&#10;and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.&#10;&#10;‘--or next day, maybe,’ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly&#10;as if nothing had happened.&#10;&#10;‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.&#10;&#10;‘ARE you to get in at all?’ said the Footman. ‘That’s the first&#10;question, you know.’&#10;&#10;It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. ‘It’s really&#10;dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue.&#10;It’s enough to drive one crazy!’&#10;&#10;The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his&#10;remark, with variations. ‘I shall sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for&#10;days and days.’&#10;&#10;‘But what am I to do?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.&#10;&#10;‘Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said Alice desperately: ‘he’s&#10;perfectly idiotic!’ And she opened the door and went in.&#10;&#10;The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from&#10;one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in&#10;the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring&#10;a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.&#10;&#10;‘There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ Alice said to herself,&#10;as well as she could for sneezing.&#10;&#10;There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess&#10;sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling&#10;alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen&#10;that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on&#10;the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.&#10;&#10;‘Please would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, for she was&#10;not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, ‘why&#10;your cat grins like that?’&#10;&#10;‘It’s a Cheshire cat,’ said the Duchess, ‘and that’s why. Pig!’&#10;&#10;She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite&#10;jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,&#10;and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--&#10;&#10;‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know&#10;that cats COULD grin.’&#10;&#10;‘They all can,’ said the Duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’&#10;&#10;‘I don’t know of any that do,’ Alice said very politely, feeling quite&#10;pleased to have got into a conversation.&#10;&#10;‘You don’t know much,’ said the Duchess; ‘and that’s a fact.’&#10;&#10;Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would&#10;be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she&#10;was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the&#10;fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at&#10;the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a&#10;shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of&#10;them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,&#10;that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.&#10;&#10;‘Oh, PLEASE mind what you’re doing!’ cried Alice, jumping up and down in&#10;an agony of terror. ‘Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose’; as an unusually&#10;large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.&#10;&#10;‘If everybody minded their own business,’ the Duchess said in a hoarse&#10;growl, ‘the world would go round a deal faster than it does.’&#10;&#10;‘Which would NOT be an advantage,’ said Alice, who felt very glad to get&#10;an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘Just think of&#10;what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes&#10;twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--’&#10;&#10;‘Talking of axes,’ said the Duchess, ‘chop off her head!’&#10;&#10;Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take&#10;the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to&#10;be listening, so she went on again: ‘Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is&#10;it twelve? I--’&#10;&#10;‘Oh, don’t bother ME,’ said the Duchess; ‘I never could abide figures!’&#10;And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of&#10;lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of&#10;every line:&#10;&#10;   ‘Speak roughly to your little boy,&#10;    And beat him when he sneezes:&#10;   He only does it to annoy,&#10;    Because he knows it teases.’&#10;&#10;         CHORUS.&#10;&#10; (In which the cook and the baby joined):--&#10;&#10;       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’&#10;&#10;While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing&#10;the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,&#10;that Alice could hardly hear the words:--&#10;&#10;   ‘I speak severely to my boy,&#10;    I beat him when he sneezes;&#10;   For he can thoroughly enjoy&#10;    The pepper when he pleases!’&#10;&#10;         CHORUS.&#10;&#10;       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’&#10;&#10;‘Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the Duchess said to Alice,&#10;flinging the baby at her as she spoke. ‘I must go and get ready to play&#10;croquet with the Queen,’ and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw&#10;a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.&#10;&#10;Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped&#10;little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, ‘just&#10;like a star-fish,’ thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting&#10;like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and&#10;straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute&#10;or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.&#10;&#10;As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to&#10;twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right&#10;ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried&#10;it out into the open air. ‘IF I don’t take this child away with me,’&#10;thought Alice, ‘they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be&#10;murder to leave it behind?’ She said the last words out loud, and the&#10;little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).&#10;‘Don’t grunt,’ said Alice; ‘that’s not at all a proper way of expressing&#10;yourself.’&#10;&#10;The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to&#10;see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had&#10;a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its&#10;eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not&#10;like the look of the thing at all. ‘But perhaps it was only sobbing,’&#10;she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any&#10;tears.&#10;&#10;No, there were no tears. ‘If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,’&#10;said Alice, seriously, ‘I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind&#10;now!’ The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible&#10;to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.&#10;&#10;Alice was just beginning to think to herself, ‘Now, what am I to do with&#10;this creature when I get it home?’ when it grunted again, so violently,&#10;that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could&#10;be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she&#10;felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.&#10;&#10;So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see&#10;it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘If it had grown up,’ she said&#10;to herself, ‘it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes&#10;rather a handsome pig, I think.’ And she began thinking over other&#10;children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying&#10;to herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change them--’ when she&#10;was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a&#10;tree a few yards off.&#10;&#10;The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she&#10;thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she&#10;felt that it ought to be treated with respect.&#10;&#10;‘Cheshire Puss,’ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know&#10;whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.&#10;‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought Alice, and she went on. ‘Would you&#10;tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’&#10;&#10;‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.&#10;&#10;‘I don’t much care where--’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.&#10;&#10;‘--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,’ Alice added as an explanation.&#10;&#10;‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if you only walk long&#10;enough.’&#10;&#10;Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.&#10;‘What sort of people live about here?’&#10;&#10;‘In THAT direction,’ the Cat said, waving its right paw round, ‘lives&#10;a Hatter: and in THAT direction,’ waving the other paw, ‘lives a March&#10;Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.’&#10;&#10;‘But I don’t want to go among mad people,’ Alice remarked.&#10;&#10;‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here. I’m mad.&#10;You’re mad.’&#10;&#10;‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘You must be,’ said the Cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have come here.’&#10;&#10;Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on ‘And how&#10;do you know that you’re mad?’&#10;&#10;‘To begin with,’ said the Cat, ‘a dog’s not mad. You grant that?’&#10;&#10;‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Well, then,’ the Cat went on, ‘you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,&#10;and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and&#10;wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.’&#10;&#10;‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat. ‘Do you play croquet with the&#10;Queen to-day?’&#10;&#10;‘I should like it very much,’ said Alice, ‘but I haven’t been invited&#10;yet.’&#10;&#10;‘You’ll see me there,’ said the Cat, and vanished.&#10;&#10;Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer&#10;things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,&#10;it suddenly appeared again.&#10;&#10;‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the Cat. ‘I’d nearly&#10;forgotten to ask.’&#10;&#10;‘It turned into a pig,’ Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back&#10;in a natural way.&#10;&#10;‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.&#10;&#10;Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not&#10;appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in&#10;which the March Hare was said to live. ‘I’ve seen hatters before,’ she&#10;said to herself; ‘the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and&#10;perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad--at least not so mad as&#10;it was in March.’ As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat&#10;again, sitting on a branch of a tree.&#10;&#10;‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.&#10;&#10;‘I said pig,’ replied Alice; ‘and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and&#10;vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.’&#10;&#10;‘All right,’ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,&#10;beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which&#10;remained some time after the rest of it had gone.&#10;&#10;‘Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,’ thought Alice; ‘but a grin&#10;without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!’&#10;&#10;She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house&#10;of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the&#10;chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It&#10;was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had&#10;nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to&#10;about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,&#10;saying to herself ‘Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost&#10;wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!’&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party&#10;&#10;There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the&#10;March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting&#10;between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a&#10;cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘Very&#10;uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice; ‘only, as it’s asleep, I&#10;suppose it doesn’t mind.’&#10;&#10;The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at&#10;one corner of it: ‘No room! No room!’ they cried out when they saw Alice&#10;coming. ‘There’s PLENTY of room!’ said Alice indignantly, and she sat&#10;down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.&#10;&#10;‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.&#10;&#10;Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.&#10;‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.&#10;&#10;‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.&#10;&#10;‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.&#10;&#10;‘It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,’ said&#10;the March Hare.&#10;&#10;‘I didn’t know it was YOUR table,’ said Alice; ‘it’s laid for a great&#10;many more than three.’&#10;&#10;‘Your hair wants cutting,’ said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice&#10;for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.&#10;&#10;‘You should learn not to make personal remarks,’ Alice said with some&#10;severity; ‘it’s very rude.’&#10;&#10;The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID&#10;was, ‘Why is a raven like a writing-desk?’&#10;&#10;‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they’ve&#10;begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,’ she added aloud.&#10;&#10;‘Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?’ said the&#10;March Hare.&#10;&#10;‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March Hare went on.&#10;&#10;‘I do,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘at least--at least I mean what I&#10;say--that’s the same thing, you know.’&#10;&#10;‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said the Hatter. ‘You might just as well say&#10;that “I see what I eat” is the same thing as “I eat what I see”!’&#10;&#10;‘You might just as well say,’ added the March Hare, ‘that “I like what I&#10;get” is the same thing as “I get what I like”!’&#10;&#10;‘You might just as well say,’ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be&#10;talking in his sleep, ‘that “I breathe when I sleep” is the same thing&#10;as “I sleep when I breathe”!’&#10;&#10;‘It IS the same thing with you,’ said the Hatter, and here the&#10;conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice&#10;thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,&#10;which wasn’t much.&#10;&#10;The Hatter was the first to break the silence. ‘What day of the month&#10;is it?’ he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his&#10;pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,&#10;and holding it to his ear.&#10;&#10;Alice considered a little, and then said ‘The fourth.’&#10;&#10;‘Two days wrong!’ sighed the Hatter. ‘I told you butter wouldn’t suit&#10;the works!’ he added looking angrily at the March Hare.&#10;&#10;‘It was the BEST butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.&#10;&#10;‘Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,’ the Hatter grumbled:&#10;‘you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.’&#10;&#10;The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped&#10;it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of&#10;nothing better to say than his first remark, ‘It was the BEST butter,&#10;you know.’&#10;&#10;Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. ‘What a&#10;funny watch!’ she remarked. ‘It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t&#10;tell what o’clock it is!’&#10;&#10;‘Why should it?’ muttered the Hatter. ‘Does YOUR watch tell you what&#10;year it is?’&#10;&#10;‘Of course not,’ Alice replied very readily: ‘but that’s because it&#10;stays the same year for such a long time together.’&#10;&#10;‘Which is just the case with MINE,’ said the Hatter.&#10;&#10;Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no&#10;sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite&#10;understand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.&#10;&#10;‘The Dormouse is asleep again,’ said the Hatter, and he poured a little&#10;hot tea upon its nose.&#10;&#10;The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its&#10;eyes, ‘Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.’&#10;&#10;‘Have you guessed the riddle yet?’ the Hatter said, turning to Alice&#10;again.&#10;&#10;‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied: ‘what’s the answer?’&#10;&#10;‘I haven’t the slightest idea,’ said the Hatter.&#10;&#10;‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.&#10;&#10;Alice sighed wearily. ‘I think you might do something better with the&#10;time,’ she said, ‘than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.’&#10;&#10;‘If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk&#10;about wasting IT. It’s HIM.’&#10;&#10;‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Of course you don’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.&#10;‘I dare say you never even spoke to Time!’&#10;&#10;‘Perhaps not,’ Alice cautiously replied: ‘but I know I have to beat time&#10;when I learn music.’&#10;&#10;‘Ah! that accounts for it,’ said the Hatter. ‘He won’t stand beating.&#10;Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything&#10;you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in&#10;the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a&#10;hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,&#10;time for dinner!’&#10;&#10;[‘I only wish it was,’ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)&#10;&#10;‘That would be grand, certainly,’ said Alice thoughtfully: ‘but then--I&#10;shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’&#10;&#10;‘Not at first, perhaps,’ said the Hatter: ‘but you could keep it to&#10;half-past one as long as you liked.’&#10;&#10;‘Is that the way YOU manage?’ Alice asked.&#10;&#10;The Hatter shook his head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ he replied. ‘We&#10;quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--’ (pointing&#10;with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) ‘--it was at the great concert&#10;given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing&#10;&#10;     “Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!&#10;     How I wonder what you’re at!”&#10;&#10;You know the song, perhaps?’&#10;&#10;‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘It goes on, you know,’ the Hatter continued, ‘in this way:--&#10;&#10;     “Up above the world you fly,&#10;     Like a tea-tray in the sky.&#10;         Twinkle, twinkle--“’&#10;&#10;Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep ‘Twinkle,&#10;twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--’ and went on so long that they had to pinch&#10;it to make it stop.&#10;&#10;‘Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,’ said the Hatter, ‘when the&#10;Queen jumped up and bawled out, “He’s murdering the time! Off with his&#10;head!”’&#10;&#10;‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.&#10;&#10;‘And ever since that,’ the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, ‘he won’t&#10;do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.’&#10;&#10;A bright idea came into Alice’s head. ‘Is that the reason so many&#10;tea-things are put out here?’ she asked.&#10;&#10;‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Hatter with a sigh: ‘it’s always tea-time,&#10;and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.’&#10;&#10;‘Then you keep moving round, I suppose?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Exactly so,’ said the Hatter: ‘as the things get used up.’&#10;&#10;‘But what happens when you come to the beginning again?’ Alice ventured&#10;to ask.&#10;&#10;‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.&#10;‘I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.’&#10;&#10;‘I’m afraid I don’t know one,’ said Alice, rather alarmed at the&#10;proposal.&#10;&#10;‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried. ‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And&#10;they pinched it on both sides at once.&#10;&#10;The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. ‘I wasn’t asleep,’ he said in a&#10;hoarse, feeble voice: ‘I heard every word you fellows were saying.’&#10;&#10;‘Tell us a story!’ said the March Hare.&#10;&#10;‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.&#10;&#10;‘And be quick about it,’ added the Hatter, ‘or you’ll be asleep again&#10;before it’s done.’&#10;&#10;‘Once upon a time there were three little sisters,’ the Dormouse began&#10;in a great hurry; ‘and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and&#10;they lived at the bottom of a well--’&#10;&#10;‘What did they live on?’ said Alice, who always took a great interest in&#10;questions of eating and drinking.&#10;&#10;‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or&#10;two.&#10;&#10;‘They couldn’t have done that, you know,’ Alice gently remarked; ‘they’d&#10;have been ill.’&#10;&#10;‘So they were,’ said the Dormouse; ‘VERY ill.’&#10;&#10;Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of&#10;living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: ‘But&#10;why did they live at the bottom of a well?’&#10;&#10;‘Take some more tea,’ the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.&#10;&#10;‘I’ve had nothing yet,’ Alice replied in an offended tone, ‘so I can’t&#10;take more.’&#10;&#10;‘You mean you can’t take LESS,’ said the Hatter: ‘it’s very easy to take&#10;MORE than nothing.’&#10;&#10;‘Nobody asked YOUR opinion,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.&#10;&#10;Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself&#10;to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and&#10;repeated her question. ‘Why did they live at the bottom of a well?’&#10;&#10;The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then&#10;said, ‘It was a treacle-well.’&#10;&#10;‘There’s no such thing!’ Alice was beginning very angrily, but the&#10;Hatter and the March Hare went ‘Sh! sh!’ and the Dormouse sulkily&#10;remarked, ‘If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for&#10;yourself.’&#10;&#10;‘No, please go on!’ Alice said very humbly; ‘I won’t interrupt again. I&#10;dare say there may be ONE.’&#10;&#10;‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to&#10;go on. ‘And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,&#10;you know--’&#10;&#10;‘What did they draw?’ said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.&#10;&#10;‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.&#10;&#10;‘I want a clean cup,’ interrupted the Hatter: ‘let’s all move one place&#10;on.’&#10;&#10;He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare&#10;moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took&#10;the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any&#10;advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than&#10;before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.&#10;&#10;Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very&#10;cautiously: ‘But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle&#10;from?’&#10;&#10;‘You can draw water out of a water-well,’ said the Hatter; ‘so I should&#10;think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?’&#10;&#10;‘But they were IN the well,’ Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to&#10;notice this last remark.&#10;&#10;‘Of course they were’, said the Dormouse; ‘--well in.’&#10;&#10;This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for&#10;some time without interrupting it.&#10;&#10;‘They were learning to draw,’ the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing&#10;its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; ‘and they drew all manner of&#10;things--everything that begins with an M--’&#10;&#10;‘Why with an M?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Why not?’ said the March Hare.&#10;&#10;Alice was silent.&#10;&#10;The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into&#10;a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with&#10;a little shriek, and went on: ‘--that begins with an M, such as&#10;mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say&#10;things are “much of a muchness”--did you ever see such a thing as a&#10;drawing of a muchness?’&#10;&#10;‘Really, now you ask me,’ said Alice, very much confused, ‘I don’t&#10;think--’&#10;&#10;‘Then you shouldn’t talk,’ said the Hatter.&#10;&#10;This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in&#10;great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and&#10;neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she&#10;looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:&#10;the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into&#10;the teapot.&#10;&#10;‘At any rate I’ll never go THERE again!’ said Alice as she picked her&#10;way through the wood. ‘It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all&#10;my life!’&#10;&#10;Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door&#10;leading right into it. ‘That’s very curious!’ she thought. ‘But&#10;everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.’ And in&#10;she went.&#10;&#10;Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little&#10;glass table. ‘Now, I’ll manage better this time,’ she said to herself,&#10;and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that&#10;led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she&#10;had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:&#10;then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at&#10;last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool&#10;fountains.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground&#10;&#10;A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses&#10;growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily&#10;painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went&#10;nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of&#10;them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like&#10;that!’&#10;&#10;‘I couldn’t help it,’ said Five, in a sulky tone; ‘Seven jogged my&#10;elbow.’&#10;&#10;On which Seven looked up and said, ‘That’s right, Five! Always lay the&#10;blame on others!’&#10;&#10;‘YOU’D better not talk!’ said Five. ‘I heard the Queen say only&#10;yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!’&#10;&#10;‘What for?’ said the one who had spoken first.&#10;&#10;‘That’s none of YOUR business, Two!’ said Seven.&#10;&#10;‘Yes, it IS his business!’ said Five, ‘and I’ll tell him--it was for&#10;bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.’&#10;&#10;Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun ‘Well, of all the unjust&#10;things--’ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching&#10;them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and&#10;all of them bowed low.&#10;&#10;‘Would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting&#10;those roses?’&#10;&#10;Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low&#10;voice, ‘Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a&#10;RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen&#10;was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.&#10;So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to--’ At this&#10;moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called&#10;out ‘The Queen! The Queen!’ and the three gardeners instantly threw&#10;themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,&#10;and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.&#10;&#10;First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like&#10;the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the&#10;corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with&#10;diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came&#10;the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came&#10;jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented&#10;with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among&#10;them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried&#10;nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without&#10;noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s&#10;crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand&#10;procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.&#10;&#10;Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face&#10;like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard&#10;of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of&#10;a procession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their&#10;faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So she stood still where she was,&#10;and waited.&#10;&#10;When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked&#10;at her, and the Queen said severely ‘Who is this?’ She said it to the&#10;Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.&#10;&#10;‘Idiot!’ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to&#10;Alice, she went on, ‘What’s your name, child?’&#10;&#10;‘My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said Alice very politely;&#10;but she added, to herself, ‘Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after&#10;all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’&#10;&#10;‘And who are THESE?’ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who&#10;were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their&#10;faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the&#10;pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or&#10;courtiers, or three of her own children.&#10;&#10;‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. ‘It’s no&#10;business of MINE.’&#10;&#10;The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a&#10;moment like a wild beast, screamed ‘Off with her head! Off--’&#10;&#10;‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was&#10;silent.&#10;&#10;The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said ‘Consider, my&#10;dear: she is only a child!’&#10;&#10;The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave ‘Turn them&#10;over!’&#10;&#10;The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.&#10;&#10;‘Get up!’ said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three&#10;gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,&#10;the royal children, and everybody else.&#10;&#10;‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen. ‘You make me giddy.’ And then,&#10;turning to the rose-tree, she went on, ‘What HAVE you been doing here?’&#10;&#10;‘May it please your Majesty,’ said Two, in a very humble tone, going&#10;down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we were trying--’&#10;&#10;‘I see!’ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.&#10;‘Off with their heads!’ and the procession moved on, three of the&#10;soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran&#10;to Alice for protection.&#10;&#10;‘You shan’t be beheaded!’ said Alice, and she put them into a large&#10;flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a&#10;minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the&#10;others.&#10;&#10;‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.&#10;&#10;‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted&#10;in reply.&#10;&#10;‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen. ‘Can you play croquet?’&#10;&#10;The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was&#10;evidently meant for her.&#10;&#10;‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Come on, then!’ roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,&#10;wondering very much what would happen next.&#10;&#10;‘It’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side. She was&#10;walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.&#10;&#10;‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘--where’s the Duchess?’&#10;&#10;‘Hush! Hush!’ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked&#10;anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon&#10;tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered ‘She’s under&#10;sentence of execution.’&#10;&#10;‘What for?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.&#10;&#10;‘No, I didn’t,’ said Alice: ‘I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said&#10;“What for?”’&#10;&#10;‘She boxed the Queen’s ears--’ the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little&#10;scream of laughter. ‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened&#10;tone. ‘The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the&#10;Queen said--’&#10;&#10;‘Get to your places!’ shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and&#10;people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each&#10;other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game&#10;began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in&#10;her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,&#10;the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves&#10;up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.&#10;&#10;The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:&#10;she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under&#10;her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got&#10;its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a&#10;blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,&#10;with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out&#10;laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin&#10;again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled&#10;itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was&#10;generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the&#10;hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up&#10;and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the&#10;conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.&#10;&#10;The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling&#10;all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short&#10;time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and&#10;shouting ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ about once in a&#10;minute.&#10;&#10;Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any&#10;dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,&#10;‘and then,’ thought she, ‘what would become of me? They’re dreadfully&#10;fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one&#10;left alive!’&#10;&#10;She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she&#10;could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance&#10;in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it&#10;a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself&#10;‘It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.’&#10;&#10;‘How are you getting on?’ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth&#10;enough for it to speak with.&#10;&#10;Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. ‘It’s no use&#10;speaking to it,’ she thought, ‘till its ears have come, or at least one&#10;of them.’ In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put&#10;down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad&#10;she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was&#10;enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.&#10;&#10;‘I don’t think they play at all fairly,’ Alice began, in rather a&#10;complaining tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear&#10;oneself speak--and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular;&#10;at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you’ve no idea how&#10;confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the&#10;arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the&#10;ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only&#10;it ran away when it saw mine coming!’&#10;&#10;‘How do you like the Queen?’ said the Cat in a low voice.&#10;&#10;‘Not at all,’ said Alice: ‘she’s so extremely--’ Just then she noticed&#10;that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,&#10;‘--likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.’&#10;&#10;The Queen smiled and passed on.&#10;&#10;‘Who ARE you talking to?’ said the King, going up to Alice, and looking&#10;at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.&#10;&#10;‘It’s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,’ said Alice: ‘allow me to&#10;introduce it.’&#10;&#10;‘I don’t like the look of it at all,’ said the King: ‘however, it may&#10;kiss my hand if it likes.’&#10;&#10;‘I’d rather not,’ the Cat remarked.&#10;&#10;‘Don’t be impertinent,’ said the King, ‘and don’t look at me like that!’&#10;He got behind Alice as he spoke.&#10;&#10;‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice. ‘I’ve read that in some book,&#10;but I don’t remember where.’&#10;&#10;‘Well, it must be removed,’ said the King very decidedly, and he called&#10;the Queen, who was passing at the moment, ‘My dear! I wish you would&#10;have this cat removed!’&#10;&#10;The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.&#10;‘Off with his head!’ she said, without even looking round.&#10;&#10;‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he&#10;hurried off.&#10;&#10;Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going&#10;on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with&#10;passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be&#10;executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look&#10;of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew&#10;whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.&#10;&#10;The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed&#10;to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the&#10;other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the&#10;other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless&#10;sort of way to fly up into a tree.&#10;&#10;By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight&#10;was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t&#10;matter much,’ thought Alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side&#10;of the ground.’ So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not&#10;escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her&#10;friend.&#10;&#10;When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a&#10;large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between&#10;the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,&#10;while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.&#10;&#10;The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle&#10;the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they&#10;all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly&#10;what they said.&#10;&#10;The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless&#10;there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a&#10;thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at HIS time of life.&#10;&#10;The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be&#10;beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.&#10;&#10;The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less&#10;than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last&#10;remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)&#10;&#10;Alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘It belongs to the Duchess:&#10;you’d better ask HER about it.’&#10;&#10;‘She’s in prison,’ the Queen said to the executioner: ‘fetch her here.’&#10;And the executioner went off like an arrow.&#10;&#10; The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,&#10;by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely&#10;disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down&#10;looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle’s Story&#10;&#10;‘You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!’&#10;said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s, and&#10;they walked off together.&#10;&#10;Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought&#10;to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so&#10;savage when they met in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;‘When I’M a Duchess,’ she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone&#10;though), ‘I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very&#10;well without--Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,’&#10;she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of&#10;rule, ‘and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes&#10;them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children&#10;sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so&#10;stingy about it, you know--’&#10;&#10;She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little&#10;startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. ‘You’re thinking&#10;about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t&#10;tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in&#10;a bit.’&#10;&#10;‘Perhaps it hasn’t one,’ Alice ventured to remark.&#10;&#10;‘Tut, tut, child!’ said the Duchess. ‘Everything’s got a moral, if only&#10;you can find it.’ And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as&#10;she spoke.&#10;&#10;Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the&#10;Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the&#10;right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an&#10;uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she&#10;bore it as well as she could.&#10;&#10;‘The game’s going on rather better now,’ she said, by way of keeping up&#10;the conversation a little.&#10;&#10;‘’Tis so,’ said the Duchess: ‘and the moral of that is--“Oh, ‘tis love,&#10;‘tis love, that makes the world go round!”’&#10;&#10;‘Somebody said,’ Alice whispered, ‘that it’s done by everybody minding&#10;their own business!’&#10;&#10;‘Ah, well! It means much the same thing,’ said the Duchess, digging her&#10;sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, ‘and the moral&#10;of THAT is--“Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of&#10;themselves.”’&#10;&#10;‘How fond she is of finding morals in things!’ Alice thought to herself.&#10;&#10;‘I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,’&#10;the Duchess said after a pause: ‘the reason is, that I’m doubtful about&#10;the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?’&#10;&#10;‘HE might bite,’ Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to&#10;have the experiment tried.&#10;&#10;‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite. And&#10;the moral of that is--“Birds of a feather flock together.”’&#10;&#10;‘Only mustard isn’t a bird,’ Alice remarked.&#10;&#10;‘Right, as usual,’ said the Duchess: ‘what a clear way you have of&#10;putting things!’&#10;&#10;‘It’s a mineral, I THINK,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Of course it is,’ said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to&#10;everything that Alice said; ‘there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And&#10;the moral of that is--“The more there is of mine, the less there is of&#10;yours.”’&#10;&#10;‘Oh, I know!’ exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,&#10;‘it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.’&#10;&#10;‘I quite agree with you,’ said the Duchess; ‘and the moral of that&#10;is--“Be what you would seem to be”--or if you’d like it put more&#10;simply--“Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might&#10;appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise&#10;than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.”’&#10;&#10;‘I think I should understand that better,’ Alice said very politely, ‘if&#10;I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.’&#10;&#10;‘That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,’ the Duchess replied, in&#10;a pleased tone.&#10;&#10;‘Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,’ said&#10;Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess. ‘I make you a present&#10;of everything I’ve said as yet.’&#10;&#10;‘A cheap sort of present!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they don’t give&#10;birthday presents like that!’ But she did not venture to say it out&#10;loud.&#10;&#10;‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp&#10;little chin.&#10;&#10;‘I’ve a right to think,’ said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to&#10;feel a little worried.&#10;&#10;‘Just about as much right,’ said the Duchess, ‘as pigs have to fly; and&#10;the m--’&#10;&#10;But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even&#10;in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked&#10;into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen&#10;in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.&#10;&#10;‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.&#10;&#10;‘Now, I give you fair warning,’ shouted the Queen, stamping on the&#10;ground as she spoke; ‘either you or your head must be off, and that in&#10;about half no time! Take your choice!’&#10;&#10;The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.&#10;&#10;‘Let’s go on with the game,’ the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was&#10;too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the&#10;croquet-ground.&#10;&#10;The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were&#10;resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried&#10;back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would&#10;cost them their lives.&#10;&#10;All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with&#10;the other players, and shouting ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her&#10;head!’ Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,&#10;who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by&#10;the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the&#10;players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and&#10;under sentence of execution.&#10;&#10;Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, ‘Have&#10;you seen the Mock Turtle yet?’&#10;&#10;‘No,’ said Alice. ‘I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.’&#10;&#10;‘It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,’ said the Queen.&#10;&#10;‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Come on, then,’ said the Queen, ‘and he shall tell you his history,’&#10;&#10;As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,&#10;to the company generally, ‘You are all pardoned.’ ‘Come, THAT’S a good&#10;thing!’ she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the&#10;number of executions the Queen had ordered.&#10;&#10;They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.&#10;(IF you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) ‘Up, lazy&#10;thing!’ said the Queen, ‘and take this young lady to see the Mock&#10;Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some&#10;executions I have ordered’; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with&#10;the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on&#10;the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go&#10;after that savage Queen: so she waited.&#10;&#10;The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till&#10;she was out of sight: then it chuckled. ‘What fun!’ said the Gryphon,&#10;half to itself, half to Alice.&#10;&#10;‘What IS the fun?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Why, SHE,’ said the Gryphon. ‘It’s all her fancy, that: they never&#10;executes nobody, you know. Come on!’&#10;&#10;‘Everybody says “come on!” here,’ thought Alice, as she went slowly&#10;after it: ‘I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!’&#10;&#10;They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,&#10;sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came&#10;nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She&#10;pitied him deeply. ‘What is his sorrow?’ she asked the Gryphon, and the&#10;Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, ‘It’s all his&#10;fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!’&#10;&#10;So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes&#10;full of tears, but said nothing.&#10;&#10;‘This here young lady,’ said the Gryphon, ‘she wants for to know your&#10;history, she do.’&#10;&#10;‘I’ll tell it her,’ said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: ‘sit&#10;down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.’&#10;&#10;So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to&#10;herself, ‘I don’t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn’t begin.’ But&#10;she waited patiently.&#10;&#10;‘Once,’ said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, ‘I was a real&#10;Turtle.’&#10;&#10;These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an&#10;occasional exclamation of ‘Hjckrrh!’ from the Gryphon, and the constant&#10;heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and&#10;saying, ‘Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,’ but she could&#10;not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said&#10;nothing.&#10;&#10;‘When we were little,’ the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,&#10;though still sobbing a little now and then, ‘we went to school in the&#10;sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--’&#10;&#10;‘Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?’ Alice asked.&#10;&#10;‘We called him Tortoise because he taught us,’ said the Mock Turtle&#10;angrily: ‘really you are very dull!’&#10;&#10;‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,’&#10;added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor&#10;Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said&#10;to the Mock Turtle, ‘Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about it!’&#10;and he went on in these words:&#10;&#10;‘Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it--’&#10;&#10;‘I never said I didn’t!’ interrupted Alice.&#10;&#10;‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.&#10;&#10;‘Hold your tongue!’ added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.&#10;The Mock Turtle went on.&#10;&#10;‘We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--’&#10;&#10;‘I’VE been to a day-school, too,’ said Alice; ‘you needn’t be so proud&#10;as all that.’&#10;&#10;‘With extras?’ asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.&#10;&#10;‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’&#10;&#10;‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.&#10;&#10;‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.&#10;&#10;‘Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said the Mock Turtle in&#10;a tone of great relief. ‘Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,&#10;“French, music, AND WASHING--extra.”’&#10;&#10;‘You couldn’t have wanted it much,’ said Alice; ‘living at the bottom of&#10;the sea.’&#10;&#10;‘I couldn’t afford to learn it.’ said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. ‘I&#10;only took the regular course.’&#10;&#10;‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the Mock Turtle&#10;replied; ‘and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,&#10;Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.’&#10;&#10;‘I never heard of “Uglification,”’ Alice ventured to say. ‘What is it?’&#10;&#10;The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. ‘What! Never heard of&#10;uglifying!’ it exclaimed. ‘You know what to beautify is, I suppose?’&#10;&#10;‘Yes,’ said Alice doubtfully: ‘it means--to--make--anything--prettier.’&#10;&#10;‘Well, then,’ the Gryphon went on, ‘if you don’t know what to uglify is,&#10;you ARE a simpleton.’&#10;&#10;Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she&#10;turned to the Mock Turtle, and said ‘What else had you to learn?’&#10;&#10;‘Well, there was Mystery,’ the Mock Turtle replied, counting off&#10;the subjects on his flappers, ‘--Mystery, ancient and modern, with&#10;Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,&#10;that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and&#10;Fainting in Coils.’&#10;&#10;‘What was THAT like?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Well, I can’t show it you myself,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘I’m too&#10;stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.’&#10;&#10;‘Hadn’t time,’ said the Gryphon: ‘I went to the Classics master, though.&#10;He was an old crab, HE was.’&#10;&#10;‘I never went to him,’ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: ‘he taught&#10;Laughing and Grief, they used to say.’&#10;&#10;‘So he did, so he did,’ said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both&#10;creatures hid their faces in their paws.&#10;&#10;‘And how many hours a day did you do lessons?’ said Alice, in a hurry to&#10;change the subject.&#10;&#10;‘Ten hours the first day,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘nine the next, and so&#10;on.’&#10;&#10;‘What a curious plan!’ exclaimed Alice.&#10;&#10;‘That’s the reason they’re called lessons,’ the Gryphon remarked:&#10;‘because they lessen from day to day.’&#10;&#10;This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little&#10;before she made her next remark. ‘Then the eleventh day must have been a&#10;holiday?’&#10;&#10;‘Of course it was,’ said the Mock Turtle.&#10;&#10;‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.&#10;&#10;‘That’s enough about lessons,’ the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided&#10;tone: ‘tell her something about the games now.’&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille&#10;&#10;The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across&#10;his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or&#10;two sobs choked his voice. ‘Same as if he had a bone in his throat,’&#10;said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in&#10;the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears&#10;running down his cheeks, he went on again:--&#10;&#10;‘You may not have lived much under the sea--’ [‘I haven’t,’ said&#10;Alice)--‘and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--’&#10;(Alice began to say ‘I once tasted--’ but checked herself hastily, and&#10;said ‘No, never’) ‘--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a&#10;Lobster Quadrille is!’&#10;&#10;‘No, indeed,’ said Alice. ‘What sort of a dance is it?’&#10;&#10;‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line along the&#10;sea-shore--’&#10;&#10;‘Two lines!’ cried the Mock Turtle. ‘Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;&#10;then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--’&#10;&#10;‘THAT generally takes some time,’ interrupted the Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘--you advance twice--’&#10;&#10;‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ cried the Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘Of course,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘advance twice, set to partners--’&#10;&#10;‘--change lobsters, and retire in same order,’ continued the Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went on, ‘you throw the--’&#10;&#10;‘The lobsters!’ shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.&#10;&#10;‘--as far out to sea as you can--’&#10;&#10;‘Swim after them!’ screamed the Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly&#10;about.&#10;&#10;‘Change lobsters again!’ yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.&#10;&#10;‘Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,’ said the Mock&#10;Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been&#10;jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly&#10;and quietly, and looked at Alice.&#10;&#10;‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.&#10;&#10;‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.&#10;&#10;‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.&#10;‘We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?’&#10;&#10;‘Oh, YOU sing,’ said the Gryphon. ‘I’ve forgotten the words.’&#10;&#10;So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and&#10;then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their&#10;forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly&#10;and sadly:--&#10;&#10; ‘“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.&#10; “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.&#10;&#10; See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!&#10; They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?&#10;&#10; Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?&#10; Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?&#10;&#10; “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be&#10; When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”&#10;  But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance--&#10; Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.&#10;&#10; Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.&#10; Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.&#10;&#10; ‘“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.&#10; “There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.&#10; The further off from England the nearer is to France--&#10; Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.&#10;&#10; Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?&#10; Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”’&#10;&#10;‘Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,’ said Alice, feeling&#10;very glad that it was over at last: ‘and I do so like that curious song&#10;about the whiting!’&#10;&#10;‘Oh, as to the whiting,’ said the Mock Turtle, ‘they--you’ve seen them,&#10;of course?’&#10;&#10;‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘I’ve often seen them at dinn--’ she checked herself&#10;hastily.&#10;&#10;‘I don’t know where Dinn may be,’ said the Mock Turtle, ‘but if you’ve&#10;seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.’&#10;&#10;‘I believe so,’ Alice replied thoughtfully. ‘They have their tails in&#10;their mouths--and they’re all over crumbs.’&#10;&#10;‘You’re wrong about the crumbs,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘crumbs would all&#10;wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the&#10;reason is--’ here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--‘Tell her&#10;about the reason and all that,’ he said to the Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘The reason is,’ said the Gryphon, ‘that they WOULD go with the lobsters&#10;to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long&#10;way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get&#10;them out again. That’s all.’&#10;&#10;‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting. I never knew so much&#10;about a whiting before.’&#10;&#10;‘I can tell you more than that, if you like,’ said the Gryphon. ‘Do you&#10;know why it’s called a whiting?’&#10;&#10;‘I never thought about it,’ said Alice. ‘Why?’&#10;&#10;‘IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.’ the Gryphon replied very solemnly.&#10;&#10;Alice was thoroughly puzzled. ‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated&#10;in a wondering tone.&#10;&#10;‘Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?’ said the Gryphon. ‘I mean, what&#10;makes them so shiny?’&#10;&#10;Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her&#10;answer. ‘They’re done with blacking, I believe.’&#10;&#10;‘Boots and shoes under the sea,’ the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,&#10;‘are done with a whiting. Now you know.’&#10;&#10;‘And what are they made of?’ Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.&#10;&#10;‘Soles and eels, of course,’ the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:&#10;‘any shrimp could have told you that.’&#10;&#10;‘If I’d been the whiting,’ said Alice, whose thoughts were still running&#10;on the song, ‘I’d have said to the porpoise, “Keep back, please: we&#10;don’t want YOU with us!”’&#10;&#10;‘They were obliged to have him with them,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘no&#10;wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.’&#10;&#10;‘Wouldn’t it really?’ said Alice in a tone of great surprise.&#10;&#10;‘Of course not,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘why, if a fish came to ME, and&#10;told me he was going a journey, I should say “With what porpoise?”’&#10;&#10;‘Don’t you mean “purpose”?’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And&#10;the Gryphon added ‘Come, let’s hear some of YOUR adventures.’&#10;&#10;‘I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,’ said&#10;Alice a little timidly: ‘but it’s no use going back to yesterday,&#10;because I was a different person then.’&#10;&#10;‘Explain all that,’ said the Mock Turtle.&#10;&#10;‘No, no! The adventures first,’ said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:&#10;‘explanations take such a dreadful time.’&#10;&#10;So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first&#10;saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,&#10;the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened&#10;their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went&#10;on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about&#10;her repeating ‘YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,’ to the Caterpillar, and the&#10;words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,&#10;and said ‘That’s very curious.’&#10;&#10;‘It’s all about as curious as it can be,’ said the Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. ‘I&#10;should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to&#10;begin.’ He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of&#10;authority over Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Stand up and repeat “‘TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,”’ said the&#10;Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!’&#10;thought Alice; ‘I might as well be at school at once.’ However, she&#10;got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster&#10;Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came&#10;very queer indeed:--&#10;&#10;  ‘’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,&#10;  “You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”&#10;   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose&#10;  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.’&#10;&#10;       [later editions continued as follows&#10;  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,&#10;  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,&#10;  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,&#10;  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]&#10;&#10;‘That’s different from what I used to say when I was a child,’ said the&#10;Gryphon.&#10;&#10;‘Well, I never heard it before,’ said the Mock Turtle; ‘but it sounds&#10;uncommon nonsense.’&#10;&#10;Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,&#10;wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.&#10;&#10;‘I should like to have it explained,’ said the Mock Turtle.&#10;&#10;‘She can’t explain it,’ said the Gryphon hastily. ‘Go on with the next&#10;verse.’&#10;&#10;‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted. ‘How COULD he turn them&#10;out with his nose, you know?’&#10;&#10;‘It’s the first position in dancing.’ Alice said; but was dreadfully&#10;puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.&#10;&#10;‘Go on with the next verse,’ the Gryphon repeated impatiently: ‘it&#10;begins “I passed by his garden.”’&#10;&#10;Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come&#10;wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--&#10;&#10;  ‘I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,&#10;  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--’&#10;&#10;    [later editions continued as follows&#10;  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,&#10;  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.&#10;  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,&#10;  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:&#10;  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,&#10;  And concluded the banquet--]&#10;&#10;‘What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,’ the Mock Turtle&#10;interrupted, ‘if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the most&#10;confusing thing I ever heard!’&#10;&#10;‘Yes, I think you’d better leave off,’ said the Gryphon: and Alice was&#10;only too glad to do so.&#10;&#10;‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?’ the Gryphon went&#10;on. ‘Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?’&#10;&#10;‘Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,’ Alice&#10;replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,&#10;‘Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her “Turtle Soup,” will you, old&#10;fellow?’&#10;&#10;The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked&#10;with sobs, to sing this:--&#10;&#10;   ‘Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,&#10;   Waiting in a hot tureen!&#10;   Who for such dainties would not stoop?&#10;   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!&#10;   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!&#10;     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!&#10;     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!&#10;   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,&#10;     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!&#10;&#10;   ‘Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,&#10;   Game, or any other dish?&#10;   Who would not give all else for two&#10;   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?&#10;   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?&#10;     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!&#10;     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!&#10;   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,&#10;     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!’&#10;&#10;‘Chorus again!’ cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun&#10;to repeat it, when a cry of ‘The trial’s beginning!’ was heard in the&#10;distance.&#10;&#10;‘Come on!’ cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried&#10;off, without waiting for the end of the song.&#10;&#10;‘What trial is it?’ Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only&#10;answered ‘Come on!’ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly&#10;came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--&#10;&#10;   ‘Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,&#10;     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!’&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?&#10;&#10;The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they&#10;arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little&#10;birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was&#10;standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard&#10;him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,&#10;and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court&#10;was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,&#10;that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--‘I wish they’d get the&#10;trial done,’ she thought, ‘and hand round the refreshments!’ But there&#10;seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about&#10;her, to pass away the time.&#10;&#10;Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read&#10;about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew&#10;the name of nearly everything there. ‘That’s the judge,’ she said to&#10;herself, ‘because of his great wig.’&#10;&#10;The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the&#10;wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did&#10;not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.&#10;&#10;‘And that’s the jury-box,’ thought Alice, ‘and those twelve creatures,’&#10;(she was obliged to say ‘creatures,’ you see, because some of them were&#10;animals, and some were birds,) ‘I suppose they are the jurors.’ She said&#10;this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of&#10;it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her&#10;age knew the meaning of it at all. However, ‘jury-men’ would have done&#10;just as well.&#10;&#10;The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. ‘What are they&#10;doing?’ Alice whispered to the Gryphon. ‘They can’t have anything to put&#10;down yet, before the trial’s begun.’&#10;&#10;‘They’re putting down their names,’ the Gryphon whispered in reply, ‘for&#10;fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.’&#10;&#10;‘Stupid things!’ Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped&#10;hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, ‘Silence in the court!’ and the&#10;King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who&#10;was talking.&#10;&#10;Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,&#10;that all the jurors were writing down ‘stupid things!’ on their slates,&#10;and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell&#10;‘stupid,’ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. ‘A nice&#10;muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!’ thought Alice.&#10;&#10;One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice&#10;could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and&#10;very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly&#10;that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out&#10;at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was&#10;obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was&#10;of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.&#10;&#10;‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.&#10;&#10;On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then&#10;unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--&#10;&#10;   ‘The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,&#10;      All on a summer day:&#10;    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,&#10;      And took them quite away!’&#10;&#10;‘Consider your verdict,’ the King said to the jury.&#10;&#10;‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. ‘There’s a great&#10;deal to come before that!’&#10;&#10;‘Call the first witness,’ said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three&#10;blasts on the trumpet, and called out, ‘First witness!’&#10;&#10;The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one&#10;hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ‘I beg pardon, your&#10;Majesty,’ he began, ‘for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished&#10;my tea when I was sent for.’&#10;&#10;‘You ought to have finished,’ said the King. ‘When did you begin?’&#10;&#10;The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the&#10;court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. ‘Fourteenth of March, I think it&#10;was,’ he said.&#10;&#10;‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.&#10;&#10;‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.&#10;&#10;‘Write that down,’ the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly&#10;wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and&#10;reduced the answer to shillings and pence.&#10;&#10;‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.&#10;&#10;‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.&#10;&#10;‘Stolen!’ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a&#10;memorandum of the fact.&#10;&#10;‘I keep them to sell,’ the Hatter added as an explanation; ‘I’ve none of&#10;my own. I’m a hatter.’&#10;&#10;Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,&#10;who turned pale and fidgeted.&#10;&#10;‘Give your evidence,’ said the King; ‘and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have&#10;you executed on the spot.’&#10;&#10;This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting&#10;from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in&#10;his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the&#10;bread-and-butter.&#10;&#10;Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled&#10;her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to&#10;grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave&#10;the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as&#10;long as there was room for her.&#10;&#10;‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.’ said the Dormouse, who was sitting&#10;next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’&#10;&#10;‘I can’t help it,’ said Alice very meekly: ‘I’m growing.’&#10;&#10;‘You’ve no right to grow here,’ said the Dormouse.&#10;&#10;‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said Alice more boldly: ‘you know you’re growing&#10;too.’&#10;&#10;‘Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,’ said the Dormouse: ‘not in that&#10;ridiculous fashion.’ And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the&#10;other side of the court.&#10;&#10;All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,&#10;just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers&#10;of the court, ‘Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!’ on&#10;which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.&#10;&#10;‘Give your evidence,’ the King repeated angrily, ‘or I’ll have you&#10;executed, whether you’re nervous or not.’&#10;&#10;‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,&#10;‘--and I hadn’t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the&#10;bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--’&#10;&#10;‘The twinkling of the what?’ said the King.&#10;&#10;‘It began with the tea,’ the Hatter replied.&#10;&#10;‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply. ‘Do you&#10;take me for a dunce? Go on!’&#10;&#10;‘I’m a poor man,’ the Hatter went on, ‘and most things twinkled after&#10;that--only the March Hare said--’&#10;&#10;‘I didn’t!’ the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.&#10;&#10;‘You did!’ said the Hatter.&#10;&#10;‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare.&#10;&#10;‘He denies it,’ said the King: ‘leave out that part.’&#10;&#10;‘Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--’ the Hatter went on, looking&#10;anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied&#10;nothing, being fast asleep.&#10;&#10;‘After that,’ continued the Hatter, ‘I cut some more bread-and-butter--’&#10;&#10;‘But what did the Dormouse say?’ one of the jury asked.&#10;&#10;‘That I can’t remember,’ said the Hatter.&#10;&#10;‘You MUST remember,’ remarked the King, ‘or I’ll have you executed.’&#10;&#10;The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went&#10;down on one knee. ‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.&#10;&#10;‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.&#10;&#10;Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by&#10;the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just&#10;explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied&#10;up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,&#10;head first, and then sat upon it.)&#10;&#10;‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice. ‘I’ve so often read&#10;in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts&#10;at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the&#10;court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.’&#10;&#10;‘If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,’ continued the&#10;King.&#10;&#10;‘I can’t go no lower,’ said the Hatter: ‘I’m on the floor, as it is.’&#10;&#10;‘Then you may SIT down,’ the King replied.&#10;&#10;Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.&#10;&#10;‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice. ‘Now we shall get&#10;on better.’&#10;&#10;‘I’d rather finish my tea,’ said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the&#10;Queen, who was reading the list of singers.&#10;&#10;‘You may go,’ said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,&#10;without even waiting to put his shoes on.&#10;&#10;‘--and just take his head off outside,’ the Queen added to one of the&#10;officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get&#10;to the door.&#10;&#10;‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.&#10;&#10;The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in&#10;her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the&#10;court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.&#10;&#10;‘Give your evidence,’ said the King.&#10;&#10;‘Shan’t,’ said the cook.&#10;&#10;The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,&#10;‘Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.’&#10;&#10;‘Well, if I must, I must,’ the King said, with a melancholy air, and,&#10;after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were&#10;nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, ‘What are tarts made of?’&#10;&#10;‘Pepper, mostly,’ said the cook.&#10;&#10;‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her.&#10;&#10;‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out. ‘Behead that Dormouse!&#10;Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his&#10;whiskers!’&#10;&#10;For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse&#10;turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had&#10;disappeared.&#10;&#10;‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief. ‘Call the next&#10;witness.’ And he added in an undertone to the Queen, ‘Really, my dear,&#10;YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead&#10;ache!’&#10;&#10;Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very&#10;curious to see what the next witness would be like, ‘--for they haven’t&#10;got much evidence YET,’ she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when&#10;the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the&#10;name ‘Alice!’&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XII. Alice’s Evidence&#10;&#10;&#10;‘Here!’ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how&#10;large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such&#10;a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,&#10;upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there&#10;they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish&#10;she had accidentally upset the week before.&#10;&#10;‘Oh, I BEG your pardon!’ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and&#10;began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of&#10;the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea&#10;that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or&#10;they would die.&#10;&#10;‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King in a very grave voice, ‘until&#10;all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,’ he repeated with&#10;great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.&#10;&#10;Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put&#10;the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its&#10;tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got&#10;it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ she said&#10;to herself; ‘I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial&#10;one way up as the other.’&#10;&#10;As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being&#10;upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to&#10;them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the&#10;accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do&#10;anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the&#10;court.&#10;&#10;‘What do you know about this business?’ the King said to Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Nothing,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Nothing WHATEVER?’ persisted the King.&#10;&#10;‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury. They were&#10;just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit&#10;interrupted: ‘UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said in a&#10;very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.&#10;&#10;‘UNimportant, of course, I meant,’ the King hastily said, and went on&#10;to himself in an undertone,&#10;&#10;‘important--unimportant--unimportant--important--’ as if he were trying&#10;which word sounded best.&#10;&#10;Some of the jury wrote it down ‘important,’ and some ‘unimportant.’&#10;Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;&#10;‘but it doesn’t matter a bit,’ she thought to herself.&#10;&#10;At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in&#10;his note-book, cackled out ‘Silence!’ and read out from his book, ‘Rule&#10;Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.’&#10;&#10;Everybody looked at Alice.&#10;&#10;‘I’M not a mile high,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘You are,’ said the King.&#10;&#10;‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.&#10;&#10;‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘besides, that’s not a&#10;regular rule: you invented it just now.’&#10;&#10;‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the King.&#10;&#10;‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. ‘Consider your&#10;verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.&#10;&#10;‘There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,’ said the White&#10;Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; ‘this paper has just been picked&#10;up.’&#10;&#10;‘What’s in it?’ said the Queen.&#10;&#10;‘I haven’t opened it yet,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘but it seems to be a&#10;letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.’&#10;&#10;‘It must have been that,’ said the King, ‘unless it was written to&#10;nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’&#10;&#10;‘Who is it directed to?’ said one of the jurymen.&#10;&#10;‘It isn’t directed at all,’ said the White Rabbit; ‘in fact, there’s&#10;nothing written on the OUTSIDE.’ He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and&#10;added ‘It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.’&#10;&#10;‘Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurymen.&#10;&#10;‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing&#10;about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.)&#10;&#10;‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King. (The jury&#10;all brightened up again.)&#10;&#10;‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they&#10;can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’&#10;&#10;‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter&#10;worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your&#10;name like an honest man.’&#10;&#10;There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really&#10;clever thing the King had said that day.&#10;&#10;‘That PROVES his guilt,’ said the Queen.&#10;&#10;‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice. ‘Why, you don’t even know&#10;what they’re about!’&#10;&#10;‘Read them,’ said the King.&#10;&#10;The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. ‘Where shall I begin, please&#10;your Majesty?’ he asked.&#10;&#10;‘Begin at the beginning,’ the King said gravely, ‘and go on till you&#10;come to the end: then stop.’&#10;&#10;These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--&#10;&#10;   ‘They told me you had been to her,&#10;    And mentioned me to him:&#10;   She gave me a good character,&#10;    But said I could not swim.&#10;&#10;   He sent them word I had not gone&#10;    (We know it to be true):&#10;   If she should push the matter on,&#10;    What would become of you?&#10;&#10;   I gave her one, they gave him two,&#10;    You gave us three or more;&#10;   They all returned from him to you,&#10;    Though they were mine before.&#10;&#10;   If I or she should chance to be&#10;    Involved in this affair,&#10;   He trusts to you to set them free,&#10;    Exactly as we were.&#10;&#10;   My notion was that you had been&#10;    (Before she had this fit)&#10;   An obstacle that came between&#10;    Him, and ourselves, and it.&#10;&#10;   Don’t let him know she liked them best,&#10;    For this must ever be&#10;   A secret, kept from all the rest,&#10;    Between yourself and me.’&#10;&#10;‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,’ said the&#10;King, rubbing his hands; ‘so now let the jury--’&#10;&#10;‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, (she had grown so large&#10;in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting&#10;him,) ‘I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s an atom of&#10;meaning in it.’&#10;&#10;The jury all wrote down on their slates, ‘SHE doesn’t believe there’s an&#10;atom of meaning in it,’ but none of them attempted to explain the paper.&#10;&#10;‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of&#10;trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,’&#10;he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them&#10;with one eye; ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “--SAID&#10;I COULD NOT SWIM--” you can’t swim, can you?’ he added, turning to the&#10;Knave.&#10;&#10;The Knave shook his head sadly. ‘Do I look like it?’ he said. (Which he&#10;certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)&#10;&#10;‘All right, so far,’ said the King, and he went on muttering over&#10;the verses to himself: ‘“WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--” that’s the jury, of&#10;course--“I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--” why, that must be what he&#10;did with the tarts, you know--’&#10;&#10;‘But, it goes on “THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,”’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Why, there they are!’ said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts&#10;on the table. ‘Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--“BEFORE SHE&#10;HAD THIS FIT--” you never had fits, my dear, I think?’ he said to the&#10;Queen.&#10;&#10;‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard&#10;as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his&#10;slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily&#10;began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as&#10;it lasted.)&#10;&#10;‘Then the words don’t FIT you,’ said the King, looking round the court&#10;with a smile. There was a dead silence.&#10;&#10;‘It’s a pun!’ the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,&#10;‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ the King said, for about the&#10;twentieth time that day.&#10;&#10;‘No, no!’ said the Queen. ‘Sentence first--verdict afterwards.’&#10;&#10;‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly. ‘The idea of having the&#10;sentence first!’&#10;&#10;‘Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen, turning purple.&#10;&#10;‘I won’t!’ said Alice.&#10;&#10;‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody&#10;moved.&#10;&#10;‘Who cares for you?’ said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this&#10;time.) ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’&#10;&#10;At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon&#10;her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and&#10;tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her&#10;head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead&#10;leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.&#10;&#10;‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said her sister; ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve&#10;had!’&#10;&#10;‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’ said Alice, and she told her&#10;sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures&#10;of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had&#10;finished, her sister kissed her, and said, ‘It WAS a curious dream,&#10;dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.’ So&#10;Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,&#10;what a wonderful dream it had been.&#10;&#10;But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her&#10;hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her&#10;wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and&#10;this was her dream:--&#10;&#10;First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny&#10;hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking&#10;up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that&#10;queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that&#10;WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to&#10;listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures&#10;of her little sister’s dream.&#10;&#10;The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the&#10;frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she&#10;could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends&#10;shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen&#10;ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby&#10;was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed&#10;around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the&#10;Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,&#10;filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock&#10;Turtle.&#10;&#10;So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in&#10;Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all&#10;would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the&#10;wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling&#10;teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill&#10;cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the&#10;shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she&#10;knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing&#10;of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s&#10;heavy sobs.&#10;&#10;Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers&#10;would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would&#10;keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her&#10;childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and&#10;make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even&#10;with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with&#10;all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,&#10;remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.&#10;&#10;              THE END&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End of Project Gutenberg’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll&#10;&#10;*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND ***&#10;&#10;***** This file should be named 11-0.txt or 11-0.zip *****&#10;This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:&#10;        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/11/&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions&#10;will be renamed.&#10;&#10;Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no&#10;one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation&#10;(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without&#10;permission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists&#10;because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from&#10;people in all walks of life.&#10;&#10;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#10;assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s&#10;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will&#10;remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#10;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.&#10;To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&#10;and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4&#10;and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#10;Literary Archive Foundation&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide&#10;spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#10;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#10;freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest&#10;array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations&#10;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#10;status with the IRS.&#10;&#10;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#10;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#10;States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#10;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#10;with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations&#10;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To&#10;SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any&#10;particular state visit http://pglaf.org&#10;&#10;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#10;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#10;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#10;approach us with offers to donate.&#10;&#10;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#10;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#10;outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#10;&#10;Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation&#10;methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other&#10;ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.&#10;To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic&#10;works.&#10;&#10;Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared&#10;with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project&#10;Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.&#10;&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed&#10;editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.&#10;unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily&#10;keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.&#10;&#10;&#10;Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:&#10;&#10;     http://www.gutenberg.org&#10;&#10;This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,&#10;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#10;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to&#10;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.&#10;"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 65 69 73 77 81 85 89 93
